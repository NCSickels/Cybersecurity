## Lesson Introduction
---
While scanning the network for vulnerabilities, the team will need to evaluate a variety of targets using several approaches. In this lesson, we’ll outline the various types of scans used to evaluate the health of network endpoints, devices, and applications. You’ll learn the different types of scans such as host discovery, TCP full connect, and web application scans. Part of this process may involve either actively scanning the network, or passively sniffing the traffic with the hopes of obtaining some interesting artifacts. Concurrently, the team will need to scope out wireless networks to assess whether the WLAN is vulnerable as well.

## Lesson Objectives
---
In this lesson, you will:

- Apply knowledge of network topology and scan identified targets using a variety of techniques, such as stealth and TCP full connect scans.
- Compile data on network traffic by gathering API requests and responses and ARP traffic while using tools such as ***Wireshark*** and ***Nessus***.
- Produce reports on wireless assets by using tools and techniques that include ***Wireless Geographic Logging Engine (WiGLE)*** and ***wardriving.***

> *5.3 Explain use cases of the following tools during the phases of a penetration test.*

During the PenTest, the team will scan the network and gather information about computing systems, servers, and applications in preparation for the next phase of the assessment. In this section, we’ll review the different types of scans along with ways to evaluate vulnerable web applications.

Let’s start with a review of the different types of scans the team will complete.

### Recognizing the Different Types of Scans
---
Scanning is one of the first steps in active reconnaissance, where the PenTest team seeks to discover potentially vulnerable hosts. During this process, you’ll apply your knowledge of network topology and locate targets using a variety of scanning techniques. In this section, we’ll compare the different types of scans. We’ll see how we can first discover hosts using a ping sweep. We’ll then move to the next logical step and identify listening ports using either a full connect scan or a stealth scan if we want to avoid being seen.

Let’s start with a closer look at how we discover network hosts.

#### Discovering Network Hosts
A discovery scan is used during reconnaissance to find hosts on a network to reveal potential targets. Commonly called a ***ping sweep***, this scan will use Nmap (or a comparable program), which sends out a series of probes on the LAN to see if any hosts are up and responding.

For example, the PenTest team can issue the command **`nmap -sn -v 192.168.1.0/24`** on a LAN, to scan for live hosts.

> [!warning] The option **`-sn`** was known as **`-sP`** in earlier versions of Nmap.

As shown in the graphic, one of the hosts is up and will respond back to the PenTest team:
![[Pasted image 20240110111337.png]]
*Using a ping sweep to check for live hosts*

While the term "ping" sweep implies that scanning will use ***Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)*** to discover hosts, most applications use a variety of protocols to detect live hosts on the network.

Probes include using protocols such as ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***, ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)***, and ***Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)***.

Because firewalls may block standard probes used during the ping sweep, several applications have other choices to attempt to determine if a host is online. Choices include using the following:

- TCP SYN Ping
- TCP ACK Ping
- UDP Ping
- IP Protocol Ping
- ARP Scan

When scanning the network for live hosts, a firewall might block the probes. In that case, the host will be treated as offline. If you are using Nmap, you might get the following message:
```
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking ping probes, try -Pn
```

If the team decides to use the option **`-Pn`** , this will forego host discovery and treat all hosts as online.

After determining the live hosts on the network, the next phase is to scan the ports of each live host to determine which services are listening. Let’s see what’s involved when running a port scan.

#### Scanning Ports
By default, when completing a ping sweep using Nmap, the application will complete the following:

1. Scan the network for live hosts
2. Run a port scan on any live hosts.

However, if the analyst uses **`-sn`**, this option will simply print available hosts.

Once the team has identified live hosts, the next step is to run a port scan to see if any live hosts have ports that are open and listening.

Port scanning is the process of determining which TCP and UDP ports are listening on the target. It is the first step in determining what services are running on the target.

The following lists some common ports and their services.

- Port 25 Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)
- Port 53 Domain Name System (DNS)
- Port 80 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Port 88 Kerberos
- Port 110 Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)

> [!warning] A port scan will generally scan the well-known ports (1 - 1023); however, the app can be set to scan a larger range.

The actual number of open ports on a single host will depend on the number of services and listening applications that are running on that machine. For example, the following shows an Nmap scan of the host 192.168.74.50:
![[Pasted image 20240110111709.png]]
*Nmap port scan example*

When port scanning, the team can use several techniques to obtain as much detail as possible about the target by using either a TCP or UDP scan.

> [!warning] If the team uses a UDP-based scan, the scanner will attempt to elicit a response from listening services. However, these scans are more difficult to fingerprint as UDP is a connectionless protocol.

The scan can either attempt to fully connect with the host and learn as much about the target as possible, or they can use a stealth scan so they can remain undetected.

Let’s see what’s involved when using a full connect scan.

#### Fully Connecting with the Target
A full scan or TCP connect scan will use a standard TCP three-way handshake. Once the connection is made, the scanner will send a TCP reset (RST) to the server to kill the connection. The scanner then logs the connection and moves on to the next port to attempt to connect to the next service.

A full scan can be used with either TCP or UDP. However, when using UDP, the scan will take considerably longer as the scanner must wait to time out if no response is received on that port.

Full scans produce the most results but are also the "noisiest" and the most likely to be detected. Common ways to evade detection include randomizing the IP addresses and ports and slowing the scan down, so as not to appear too obvious.

Another way to avoid detection is by scanning in stealth mode.

#### Operating in Stealth Mode
Network devices are tuned to identify malicious activity, such as scanning the network. To avoid detection the team can use a stealth scan. With a stealth scan, the communication is generally one-sided as there is no response expected. As a result, there is a lesser chance of being noticed.

Stealth scans include the following:

- **TCP SYN (or half-open) scan** is the original stealth scan. The scan sends a packet to the target with the SYN flag set. This is called a "half-open" scan because the attacker does not complete the TCP three-way handshake.
- **FIN scan** sends a packet to the target with only the FIN flag set.
- **NULL scan** is a packet sent without any flags set.
- **XMAS Tree scan** sends a packet with the FIN, URG, and PSH flags set and appears to be “lit up like a Christmas Tree.”

The following screenshot shows a TCP SYN Scan, as shown in Wireshark:
![[Pasted image 20240110111802.png]]
*A TCP SYN scan in Wireshark (Screenshot courtesy of Wireshark.)*

Within the capture we see the columns listed as follows:

1. The TCP Flags, which in every case are all using the SYN flag.
2. The destination ports, which show the scan moving through each sequential port.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">When using a SYN scan, the response will indicate the state as follows:</mark>

- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If the port is open, the target will return a SYN ACK.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If the port is closed, the target will return a reset (RST).</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If the target is filtered using a firewall, the packet will be dropped and no response is sent.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When using a XMAS Tree, Null or FIN scan, the response will indicate the state as follows:</mark>

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If the port is open, there will be no response.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If the port is closed, the target will return a reset (RST).</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If the target is filtered using a firewall, the packet will be dropped and no response is sent.
</mark>
A stealth scan uses techniques that try to exploit the expected behavior of TCP. When used alone, the scans may have limited effectiveness. However, using a stealth scan in combination with other features of Nmap can prove to be more fruitful.

In addition to actively scanning the network, the analysts may also be tasked with scanning the target to determine if they have any vulnerable web applications. Let’s see what’s involved next.

### Assessing Vulnerable Web Applications
---
Web applications are scripts and executables designed to improve the functionality of a website and offer services to clients. Web servers will generally run on standard TCP port 80 and port 443; however, they can be configured to use non-traditional ports as well.

In this section, we’ll discuss the importance of testing web applications and servers for vulnerabilities. In addition, because of the complexity of scanning systems and applications, we’ll outline how the team can employ automated scanning to streamline the process.

Let’s start with ways analysts can test a website for vulnerabilities.

#### Crawling Web Applications
As part of the project scope, the team may be tasked with scanning a web server and applications for security vulnerabilities. The process involves activities such as:

- Crawling through web pages to gather usable content
- Scraping data found on a website.
- Examining links and discovering assets

The PenTest team can test for vulnerabilities with preconfigured or custom scans, using manual or automated methods. In addition to general considerations, the scan results will depend on whether the team is running a credentialed or non-credentialed scan. The difference is as follows:

- A **credentialed scan** uses credentials such as usernames and passwords, to take a deep dive during the vulnerability scan, which will produce more information while auditing the network.
- A **non-credentialed scan** is a scan that uses fewer permissions, and many times can only find missing patches or updates.

Web application scanners will interact with the web application and examine elements such as form fields and code for identified vulnerabilities and sensitive content. Today there are many commercial web application scanners, from vendors such as Acunetix, Qualys, and Netsparker. In addition, there are also open-source scanners and web crawlers, such as those built within Kali Linux, as shown in the screenshot:

![[Pasted image 20240110114752.png]]
*Web crawlers within Kali Linux*

When dealing with web applications, it’s also important to check for exposed or unprotected Application Programming Interface (API) information within the code.

#### Examining API Requests
An API is a set of commands that is used to send and receive data between systems, such as a client and a server. When used, the API provides an additional layer of security as the client never interfaces directly with the server. For example, when someone requests content from a web page, the request is sent from the browser to a remote server’s API, as shown in the graphic:
![[Pasted image 20240110115421.png]]
*Requesting content from a web server*

API vulnerabilities are common. As a result, the PenTest team should search for exposed information such as an API key in the source code, as shown in the graphic:
![[Pasted image 20240110115444.png]]
*Visible API found in source code*

An API with the appropriate key and authorization token can allow a malicious actor to gain access to sensitive data.

Scanning for vulnerabilities can be a lengthy, time consuming process. While some of the scanning process can be done manually, most professional PenTesting teams will use automated tools to drill through sites for the presence of known vulnerabilities.

### Automating Vulnerability Scanning
---
When the PenTest team plans the assessment, they will most likely scan from the outside looking in to the web server, which is similar to what would be seen by a malicious actor.

Application vulnerability testing methods are commonly grouped into two main categories:

- ***Static Application Security Testing (SAST)*** is done early in the software development life cycle to examine the code for security vulnerabilities.
- ***Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)*** is done _after_ the code is placed in production. Unlike SAST, dynamic testing will unearth vulnerabilities that are evident after the code is in production.

Today, many web applications adhere to industry standards when creating interfaces and backend applications. However, these applications can still be vulnerable to issues such as insecure server configuration, Cross-site scripting, SQL Injection, and Path Traversal. To take the guesswork out of this process and continuously monitor systems for vulnerabilities, the team can use the ***Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)***. SCAP is a US standard used to ensure applications are in-line with mandated security requirements. Scanning will use a predetermined security baseline that checks for vulnerabilities, either on-site or cloud based. Once identified, the next step is to mitigate the vulnerabilities to decrease overall organizational risk.

## Topic 6B - Evaluate Network Traffic
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *2.2 Given a scenario, perform active reconnaissance.*
> *2.3 Given a scenario, analyze the results of a reconnaissance exercise.*
> *3.7 Given a scenario, perform post-exploitation techniques.*
> *5.3 Explain use cases of the following tools during the phases of a penetration test.*

During the PenTest process, the team will investigate vulnerabilities on the Local Area Network (LAN). This process can include passively sniffing the traffic to gather information being passed in plain text or by actively scanning the network. In this segment, we’ll investigate ways we examine network traffic by using tools such as Wireshark and Nessus. By evaluating the traffic, this will ensure the networks have been properly segmented to protect assets and data stores.

Let’s start by seeing how we can gather traffic in motion using Wireshark.

### Sniffing Using Wireshark
---
Packet sniffing is used to examine network traffic to better understand the characteristics and structure of the traffic flow. Sniffing traffic is a straightforward way for the PenTest team to passively obtain information about the network, and can be used to identify the following:

- Network hosts, services, and device types
- Protocols, subnets, IP, and MAC addresses

Sniffing can take advantage of cleartext protocols and data traveling across the network. The analyst can learn a great deal about the network by monitoring protocols such as: TCP, ARP, SMTP, HTTP, and others. If the traffic is in cleartext, you can capture credentials, files, images, messages, and data meant for other users and machines.

Sniffers such as Wireshark have the ability to recreate entire TCP sessions. However, even if the payload is encrypted, you can still extrapolate vital information that includes:

- Source and destination address and ports
- WLAN SSIDs and accompanying cleartext messages.
- Handshakes and outside wrapper IP addresses of VPN traffic

To effectively use packet analysis, the team will need to select an appropriate location to visualize the traffic. Keep in mind, depending on the placement, you may only be able to capture a portion of the total network traffic.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The team can conduct packet analysis on an individual host. However, the view of network traffic is limited as each switchport is its own collision domain. Therefore, if the protocol analyzer is sniffing on a switch, you will only see broadcasts, multicasts, and unicast traffic.</mark>

To see all traffic on a switch, the network administrator can use ***port mirroring*** or ***Switched Port Analysis (SPAN)***. If you need to monitor all traffic on a backbone, you can use a full duplex tap in line with traffic; however, you will most likely need a special adapter.

To effectively monitor network traffic there are a couple of guidelines:

- The sniffer's interface must be in promiscuous mode to gather all traffic.
- If the team is testing a WLAN, the sniffer must be within radio range.

Next let’s see how Wireshark can help discover network hosts.

#### Discovering Network Hosts
When on a LAN, the team can use Wireshark to passively gather and examine data to discover network hosts by using a variety of protocols.

One such protocol is NetBIOS, which provides a framework for name resolution, registration, and conflict detection on a LAN. Using Wireshark, you can garner host information from traffic passing through the network contained in ***NetBIOS name service (NBNS)*** messages. Using the display filter **`nbns`**, you can drill down into the nbns header to discover host information, as shown in the screenshot:

![[Pasted image 20240110140045.png]]
*Capturing user account information using NBNS in Wireshark (Screenshot courtesy of Wireshark.)*

In addition, when assessing traffic on a Windows machine in an ***Active Directory (AD)*** environment, we can find user account names found in Kerberos traffic. As shown in the screenshot below, we can see the ***Canonical Name (CName)*** string, which is the username that is to be authenticated:

![[Pasted image 20240110140126.png]]
*Capturing user account information using Kerberos in Wireshark (Screenshot courtesy of Wireshark.)*

We can also use Wireshark to evaluate a TCP HTTP stream. If we select a packet and then right click to follow the HTTP stream, Wireshark will present the following:

![[Pasted image 20240110140226.png]]
*Capturing user agent information in an HTTP header (Screenshot courtesy of Wireshark.)*

We can also view information from ***Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)*** traffic, which dynamically assigns IP addresses to network hosts. When examining DHCP traffic, the analysis will be able to view elements such as the ***Client Identifier (MAC address)***, as well as Host Name in plain text.

There are most likely other artifacts as well. It may take some patience to comb through a packet capture. However, it can be well worth your time as you might discover some valuable information traveling through the network.

> [!important] Windows Host Name Resolution Sequence
> On Windows systems, host name resolution generally uses the sequence: 
> 1. Check if name is queried
> 2. Search local Hosts file
> 3. DNS servers queried
> 4. NetBIOS name resolution sequence.

Another tool that can provide valuable insight on the network is Nessus. Let’s take a look.

### Scanning With Nessus
---
Nessus is a powerful scanning tool that is able to scan either enterprise or home networks.

> [!warning] Nessus for home or personal use is free. If running on an enterprise network, you will need to purchase the product to take advantage of all of the features.

Nessus Essentials is available for download for students. Once you download the app, you will be able to view available scans as shown in the following screenshot:

![[Pasted image 20240110143204.png]]
*Nessus essentials interface (Screenshot courtesy of TenableÂ® Inc.)*

Once in the interface, you can create and name a basic network scan, and then run the scan. Depending on the size of your network, this may take an hour or more to run. Once done, you will be able to view the scan results as shown below:

![[Pasted image 20240110143235.png]]
*Nessus scan results (Screenshot courtesy of TenableÂ® Inc.)*

Scanning an enterprise network can be a time-consuming process. To improve the efficiency of the scan, the team can create a policy that includes key network credentials. Once created, the credentials are stored and can be used for any future scans.

Nessus can complete a basic or advanced network scan, along with testing web applications and other scans to measure the effectiveness of your security controls.

In addition to vulnerability scans, Nessus can help ensure the network is properly segmented. Let’s take a look.

#### Testing for Network Segmentation
A network segment is a portion of a network where all attached hosts can communicate freely with one another. In contrast, network segmentation _logically separates_ each segment using subnets, Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), and or firewalls to isolate each segment from one another. Separating the networks prevents them from being able to communicate with one another.

As shown in the graphic, there is a boundary between the General network, Storage Area Network (SAN), Internet of Things (IoT) VLAN, and the Voice VLAN:

![[Pasted image 20240110143307.png|670]]
*Segmenting the network*

Properly segmenting the network is good practice. In addition, it may result in several additional benefits, such as when testing systems in-scope for PCI DSS. In order to reduce the number of systems in scope, segmentation may be used to keep in-scope systems separated from out-of-scope systems. Network segmentation of the ***cardholder data environment (CDE)*** from the remainder of an entity’s network may reduce:  

• The scope of the PCI DSS assessment  
• The cost of the PCI DSS assessment  
• The cost and difficulty of implementing and maintaining PCI DSS controls  
• The risk to an organization

Nessus has a suite of PCI plugins to make the scan more efficient. When running, Nessus will output a report as to whether or not the network is PCI DSS compliant, along with specific areas of remediation.

> [!warning] The team can also use Nmap to test for network segmentation using ICMP, TCP, and UDP port scans between the two systems.

During a PenTest, the team will gather information on the network to prepare for the next phase. Next, let’s take a look at how we can obtain ***Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)*** traffic.

> [!important] Switch spoofing is an attack technique that can allow the attacker visibility into traffic on VLANs other than their native VLAN. Switch spoofing relies on a switch interface that is configured as either dynamic desirable, dynamic auto, or trunk mode, allowing an attacker to generate dynamic trunk protocol messages, and subsequently access traffic from all VLANs.

### Gathering ARP Traffic
---
During active reconnaissance, the team will gather intel to help prepare for the next phase. Part of this process will most likely involve gathering MAC addresses, as they can be useful in several ways. One reason the team might gather ARP traffic is to discover hosts on a network. An attacker might want to conduct reconnaissance against MAC addresses so that they identify devices on the same Layer 2 switch to conduct various tailored attacks against.

> [!warning] Gathering ARP traffic will only work on a LAN as ARP is not routable.

For example, the team might use MAC addresses to launch an ARP poisoning attack. This attack deliberately maps an incorrect MAC address to a correct IP address, which poisons the ARP cache. ***ARP poisoning*** is used to redirect traffic for malicious purposes. This technique is one of the most common spoofing mechanisms used on Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks, as it allows an attacker to insert themselves in a man-in-the-middle attack between two legitimate hosts.

To gather ARP traffic, the team can use the following:

- **Nessus**, which has several plugins to enumerate MAC addresses on targets
- **Nmap** can also gather MAC addresses by using the following command : **`nmap -PR -sn <target>`** . In this command, **`-PR`** will do an ARP ping and **`-sn`** will disable a port scan.
- **Arping** is a tool found in Kali Linux. Arping will send a series of ARP requests to the target. The target will send an ARP reply in response.

> [!warning] When using Arping, you will need to use Wireshark and use arp as the display filter to see the response.


## Topic 6C - Uncover Wireless Assets
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *2.2 Given a scenario, perform active reconnaissance.*
> *3.2 Given a scenario, research attack vectors and perform wireless attacks.*
> *5.3 Explain use cases of the following tools during the phases of a penetration test.*

As part of scanning the network, the team might need to evaluate wireless assets. In this section, we’ll cover the concept of wardriving, or actively searching for open access points, and how the Wireless Geographic Logging Engine (WiGLE) can help in this effort. We’ll then summarize which ways we can amplify the Wi-Fi signal to improve the signal range.

First let’s outline the concept of war driving.

### War Driving Open Access Points
---
Wireless networks are ubiquitous today and allow us to freely roam and keep connected with the outside world. Along with this convenience comes the threat of malicious actors joining an unsecured network and being able to access our communications.

In addition, Wi-Fi is a radio wave that can pass through walls and windows. As a result, a malicious actor can be outside of a building and access a wireless network.

Organizations seek to ensure that all of their network devices have been properly secured. However, it’s best to periodically check the security of ***wireless access points (WAP)*** for several reasons, that include:
- Someone may have installed a rogue access point.
- During installation of a new AP, someone may have failed to properly lock down the device.

During reconnaissance, the PenTest will focus on discovering open and unsecured WAPs that the target might have in place.
For this exercise, the team can use ***war driving***, a technique that involves driving around to search for open access points using a laptop or smartphone.

> [!warning] The term war driving implies that it’s necessary to drive around and search for an unsecured WAP. However, the team can also walk around a location, such as a campus, to identify open APs.

The team can use tools such as ***Aircrack-ng***, ***Kismet***, or ***Wifite*** to search for open WAPs. In addition, it’s beneficial to have packet analysis software running during the test to gather and save the information. After analysis, the information can then be used to launch an active attack.

While testing the target’s WAP are mainly contained to the main headquarters, there may be a need to test remote locations, such as the office of a per diem contractor. In that case, the team will need to adjust the process to test the remote location. While this might require an on-site visit, another option might be to use the ***Wireless Geographic Logging Engine (WiGLE)***. Let’s see what’s involved next.

#### Mapping WAP Using WiGLE
WiGLE is a site dedicated to mapping and indexing access points. When WiGLE first became available in 2001, many wardrivers used the site to locate open access points to use the “free Internet.”

> [!warning] While early on it was relatively easy to locate an open access point, times have changed. With improved devices and user education, there are significantly less open access points today.

WiGLE is considered an OSINT tool to help during the reconnaissance phase of PenTesting.

To get the true functionality of WiGLE, you’ll need to create an account. Once you are in the interface, you can do the following:

1. Enter a location, such as a city or specific address
2. Choose an appropriate date range
3. Select an option, for example “Possible Freenet"

Once you have selected a location and set your filters, the interface will be populated with dots. Each dot represents an access point, where you can zoom in to learn more about that AP.

> [!warning] An open AP will be identified using the label “Free Love"

In addition, WiGLE can also be used in several different views. In the lower right-hand corner of the interface, you will see a drop-down menu to select a view, that includes Standard, Satellite, Nightvision, Greyscale and Hybrid.
To thoroughly test wireless networks, it’s critical to have the appropriate signal strength. Let’s explore this concept, next.

### Amplifying the Wi-Fi Signal
---
A Wi-Fi signal is the amount of power used in an access point or station. The goal is to have a good ***Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)***, which is measurement of a wireless signal level in relation to any background noise.

The signal _strength_ of a wireless antenna is referred to as ***decibels per isotropic (dBi)*** and can vary according to the design.

When either war driving or PenTesting the wireless network, amplifying the signal can make a difference in the results.

The PenTesting team might have a variety of antennas, for different locations, as shown in the graphic:
![[Pasted image 20240603142750.png| 670]]
*Antenna design with varying signal strength*

When conducting the PenTest, it’s best to select an antenna based on the specific needs. For example, the team might select from an 11dBi antenna for long range reconnaissance, or a five dBi antenna for an office. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In addition, antennas can also vary in the way they disperse a signal. For example, the antenna can be:</mark>

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Directional in the signal coverage is limited to a specified direction.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Omni-directional transmits a signal in all directions.</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Parabolic which has a curved surface that has a fixed pattern, similar to a laser beam.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Wireless networks are another attack vector, but as we have seen there are plenty of tools and techniques that we can use to test the strength of the target’s wireless infrastructure.</mark>
