## Lesson Introduction
---
Once the PenTest is complete, it’s time to report the findings to the stakeholders. It is important to recognize that each stakeholder will have different needs, and the report should be built accordingly. In the final report, there are several sections.

The team should include all essential information related to the PenTest within sections, such as business impact analysis, metrics, and measures, along with remediation suggestions. In addition, because of regulatory requirements, the organization will most likely need to maintain the report for a predefined period of time.

## Lesson Objectives
---
In this lesson, you will:

- Compare the different audience types and recognize the unique needs of each type when preparing the report.
- Summarize each of the report components and outline the type of information included for each section.
- Recommend best practice guidelines for preserving reports along with other PenTest artifacts and records.

## Topic 18A - Identifying Report Audience

*4.1 Compare and contrast the important components of written reports.*

One of the important considerations when you are creating a PenTest report is to determine the target audience. Different sorts of PenTest engagements will have different sets of stakeholders from the organization whose information systems are being tested.

For the purposes of this lesson, let's consider an organization to be the client. Consider the following:

- The types of information systems being tested definitely affect the composition of the target audience. For instance, if a PenTest engagement is limited to penetrating networks and hosts but does not focus on testing web or other applications, the client might decide there is no need to include web developers in the target audience.
- The stakeholders most likely to be part of the target audience might be a combination of upper-level managers, IT management and personnel, and other individuals who will be directly affected by the PenTest engagement. Several representatives of the client's security or IT team might also be part of the target audience.

Whether the PenTest team is an internal entity or an external consultant is another factor to consider. For internal teams, their representatives from upper management are likely to overlap, while external consultants' management teams will be different individuals.

### Reporting to Senior Management
---
**C-Suite** refers to top-level management personnel, usually with “chief” in their name, such as CEO, CTO, CIO, CSO, CISO, etc. These are senior executives that are likely to be responsible for making decisions based on the results and recommendations.

Implementing recommendations can be costly, such as when employing security solutions or updating several vulnerable devices, but are offset by facing reduced business efficiency, etc. For this reason, it is important for the C-Suite to understand the impact of the findings.

### Including Third-Party Stakeholders
---
**Third-Party stakeholders** are the people not directly involved with the client but who may still be involved in a process related to the penetration test report. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">These include providers, investors, regulators, and similar entities.</mark>

The objective is usually for regulatory compliance, continued secure operations, and determining if the organization has a proper cybersecurity posture. In these cases, it can help a great deal to show the relationship between activities performed and an industry-standard security framework.

### Sharing Information with Technical Staff
---
**Technical Staff** are the personnel that maintain the systems that were tested. As such, they are likely responsible for implementing or aiding in implementing some of the solutions to the issues found during the penetration test.

A lot of the finer details of the vulnerabilities and the way in which they were exploited can be of value for the technical staff in order to determine resolution or mitigation strategies that minimize business impact.

### Providing Details to Developers
---
**Developers** are the personnel responsible for creating and maintaining a solution, usually referring to the software development of an application, website, or something similar.

In cases where the target was a project for which developers are particularly responsible, they will be directly involved in implementing all the resolution and mitigation techniques that need to be addressed. Often these can be addressed through the adoption of secure software development practices.

## Topic 18B - List Report Contents
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *4.1 Compare and contrast the important components of written reports.*

The written report is likely to be read by a variety of audiences. This might include board members, end users, and technical administrators. They all need to be able to read and understand the information you provide. So you need to target your reports to account for these differences.

A common way of achieving this is through organizing the report into appropriate subdivisions. There might be an executive section for those who only need a high-level understanding of the results and their impact. There might be technical section with links to more specialized information that IT personnel can use to implement your recommendations.

You can also create an appendix, providing essential information in the report and separate files with all details. Essentially, you want to normalize data in the report to make it as clear to the target audience as possible, all while minimizing extraneous information that just contributes to the noise.

### Defining the Executive Summary
---
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">An executive summary is a high-level and concise overview of the penetration test, its findings, and their impact.</mark> It may typically range from two paragraph to two pages, depending on the client’s objective, the industry, the size of the organization, and other factors.

It aims at providing a summary of the process and results: a brief and simple explanation of the procedure, notable findings expressed in a non-technical manner, and some of their implications.

It is recommended to end with a conclusion statement such as, *“In conclusion, the network, systems, and processes have been found to be <insecure/secure>.”*

### Outlining the Scope Details
---
This section of the report details the scope that was defined for the activity during the pre-engagement phase. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It includes any deviation from the original scope and the reason(s) for it.</mark> It may occur that some alterations were requested by the client, or unexpected events change the course of action of the PenTest team.

This section should not come as any surprise to the client, because they should already be fully aware of the original scope and any deviations from it. This section should be a simple formality.

### Stepping Through the Methodology
---
***Methodology*** is a high-level description of the standards or framework that were followed to conduct the penetration test.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This section should outline the activities performed, usually in a generic manner, and may mention some additional details, such as what is being targeted on each portion of the testing, and what tools, techniques, and procedures were used for each.</mark>

### Detailing the Attack Narrative
---
The ***attack narrative*** is a detailed explanation of the steps taken while performing the activities.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">This section will guide the reader through the process performed by the penetration testing team, and it should show correlation between the methodology that was mentioned and the activities performed.</mark>

In cases where an event occurred that modified the scope, the attack narrative would mention this and show what followed. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">It will commonly express, in detail, about paths and whether exploits were successful, while only briefly talking about the rest.</mark>

### Listing the Findings
---
This section shows the issues that were identified during the activity.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">These are often presented with a table that identifies the vulnerability, the threat level, the risk rating, and whether the vulnerability was able to be exploited.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">When tailoring the report to the client’s objective and risk appetite, you may first consider elements such as critical vulnerabilities, attack vectors successfully exploited, and other results.</mark>

You can append or attach a full list of results as a separate file. This section should include steps that can be independently repeated so that findings can be validated.

### Determining Risk Appetite
---
The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept, or its ***risk appetite***, must be determined by each organization. Risk appetite refers to the amount and type of potential vulnerabilities and threats the organization is willing to tolerate and endure. This is another balancing act as the organization determines how much risk they are willing to endure versus how much it would cost to mitigate the risk and the difficulty of implementing mitigation strategies.

The client's key stakeholders need to determine their risk appetite by answering questions such as:

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">What losses would be catastrophic to the organization?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">What processes, technology, or other assets can be unavailable and still enable the organization to function and for how long?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">What assets, processes, information, or technology must be available at all times and cannot be made public or be accessed by unapproved persons?</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Are there any circumstances that could result in personal harm to anyone dealing with the organization, be it employees, customers, business partners, or visitors?</mark>

Your PenTest report should account for the client's risk appetite. For example, you can determine the level of risk a vulnerability poses by using the standard "Probability x Impact" formula. Then, you can compare the result of this assessment to the organization's risk appetite and determine whether or not the risk falls within the accepted tolerance level.

You can do this in a number of ways, including visually through charts and graphs. This will help the client organization better understand the impact of a risk than if you had simply quantified the risk without regard to the client's appetite.

### Risk Rating (Reference Framework)
---
***Risk rating*** is the process of assigning values to the identified risks. This is usually done by following a reference framework, which is a method to consistently rate findings..

To achieve this consistency, relevant elements need to be taken into account, such as exploit ability and the location where the vulnerability is located (internal network or Internet-facing, etc.).

A common way to rate risk is by taking these elements into account to determine the likelihood of a finding to be targeted by a malicious actor and the impact it would have if it were successfully exploited:
![[Pasted image 20240701102847.png | 650]]
*Risk rating framework.*

There are established systems that can further enhance risk ratings, like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), as well as different types of cybersecurity frameworks such as National Institute of Standards and Technology, Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF):

*National Institute of Standards and Technology, Cyber Security Framework (NIST CSF).*

### Prioritizing Risk
---
***Risk prioritization*** is the process of adjusting the final rating of vulnerabilities to the client needs.

Depending on their industry and other factors, you and the client need to work together to prioritize the results of your testing. Be aware that, in some cases, what seems to be the most urgent item to you might not be quite as urgent based on the organization's need to comply with standards, organizations, the existence of older or specialized hardware, or other factors.

For example, compliance with PCI DSS might be the highest priority for the organization even if there are other vulnerabilities that are marked as a higher severity.

Depending on the client's industry, you may need to consider items such as ***Personally Identifiable Information (PII)*** and ***Protected Health Information (PHI)*** in addition to other factors such as network accessibility, building accessibility, and the like.

These can all influence how you prioritize the results of the PenTest. Ultimately, it is important to understand that there is more nuance to results prioritization than just labeling something as "medium" severity because the CVSS says so.

### Analyzing Business Impact
---
A post-activity ***business impact analysis (BIA)*** involves estimating the possible effects to the client if the issues identified during the activity were to be targeted by a malicious actor.

In terms of maintaining normal organization functionality, different attacks vectors found during the penetration test will have different types of impact on the client and, accordingly, varying consequences and costs.

This section of the report will provide a better understanding of the relationship between the findings and their implications and allow the client to better determine the priority given to allocating resources to implement resolutions to the findings.

### Defining Metrics and Measures
---
***Metrics*** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">are quantifiable measurements of the status of results or processes. An example of a metric related to PenTesting is the criticality of vulnerability findings. This metric can be expressed on a scale, for example, from 1 to 10.</mark>

***Measures*** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">are the specific data points that contribute to a metric. Using the same criticality metric as an example, the measures might be something like the percentage of hosts susceptible to a particularly critical vulnerability or the total number of critical vulnerabilities found throughout the client's assets, etc.</mark>

Metrics and measures are important to include in a report because they demonstrate to the client quantifiable data about the test's findings. They can be shown as tables or graphs to better display the results and allow for easy analysis, such as year-to-year changes in the number of successfully exploited attack vectors.

### Suggesting Remediation
---
Remediation is the possible solution to the issue identified during the penetration test.

The following table lists some of the findings that are often discovered during PenTesting and some remediation measures to consider taking. There are often more remediation measures the client can take to address a particular vulnerability.

You should present as many as you have time to include in your recommendation to the client. Giving the client options enables them to choose the solution that is right for them and their organization. One might be cheaper or easier to use but another might be more comprehensive, reliable, or more certain of mitigation success.

### Outlining the Final Report Sections
---
#### Conclusion
This section wraps up the report. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It should include a general summary statement about failures and successes, with supporting evidence that can be written in a sentence or two.</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It should also include a statement of the PenTest goals and whether those goals were met.</mark> You can get more specific about potential attacks and what assets such an attack could leverage. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Identify the areas that are most likely to be compromised and recommend that those be dealt with as soon as possible.</mark>

#### Appendix
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Any supporting evidence, or attestation of findings, should be attached to the report. This might include printouts of test results, screenshots of network activity, and other evidence you obtained during testing.</mark>

Additionally, it can include full versions of some of the highlights done in the report or a reference to a file if provided as attachment.

As an example, the full analysis done on findings can be provided as a spreadsheet with vulnerabilities, risk rating, and other details, and only the prioritized findings can be included in the report. This can help offload the report and keep only the most important information, without the client missing any of the issues identified during the penetration test.

## Topic 18C - Define Best Practices for Reports
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *4.1 Compare and contrast the important components of written reports.*

The report is the showcase of the PenTest. In order to present a polished and professional report, it is advisable to use best practices, a framework, and other proven formulas.

Additionally, it must be remembered that a report is a confidential document containing sensitive information and so should be treated as such.

In this section, you will be provided with suggestions for how to construct the report, content that should be included, and methods on how to preserve and disseminate the document.

### Storing Reports
---
Depending on different factors such as a client’s objectives, continued penetration testing and retesting, or a client’s industry and compliance requirements, you will need to define storage time for reports and supporting documentation. This may include evidence, notes written during the assessment, and other elements that we will be discussing next, as they can aid in different areas of post-engagement activities. Also, the sensitivity of what you are storing may alter the time you wish to store it, as you will see in the following information.

To help keep track of stored reports and documentation, it is recommended to maintain document control of stored reports, as well as other relevant information. For storage, the most applicable ones are start and end date of activities and the date of the last revision to the report.

In general, you should consider implementing the following components into the reports:

|    **Component**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

It might also include <br>other fields such as the names of the PenTest team <br>members, names of those who have accessed and <br>viewed the report, approver name if stored in a system <br>that allows documents to be approved or rejected <br>(such as SharePoint), and a document of classification <br>information (as determined by the testers or target <br>organization as defined in the SOW). |
|   version control   | This is typically implemented as a table to track<br> changes made to the report. The tracked information <br>includes a description of any changes that are made, who <br>made the changes, the date of the change, and the updated <br>version number (it might be a full version increment or a <br>"point" version, again based on the terms defined in the SOW).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Securing Report Distribution
---
Because PenTest reports contain highly detailed information about the areas that are vulnerable to attack, you and the client will both need to take precautions to prevent the reports from falling into the wrong hands. If possible, store the reports on a secure server and don't pass the report via external drives. Within the client organization, the file system should be secured so that only the appropriate personnel are able to view the details of the full report.

There are likely some parts of the report that need to be made available to additional personnel. For this reason, consider storing reports in repositories where parts of the report can be secured with varying levels of access.

In addition to access control, encrypting the reports in storage will go a long way toward making sure unauthorized parties cannot read them and glean sensitive data.

You also need to determine how long to store the report for in order to minimize the risk it poses. Discuss with the client the expected storage time for the report.

The following are some best practices for the secure handling of reports:

- Maintain the confidentiality of reports and their contents.
- Maintain the integrity of reports and their contents.
- Ensure reports are always available to the relevant audience.
- Ensure reports are secure in transit (including across a network).
- Minimize the transmission of reports across a public network like the internet.
- Ensure reports are secure in storage.
- Protect reports and their contents from accidental disclosure.
- Maintain audit logs for users accessing reports.
- Maintain a chain of custody when transferring ownership of reports.
- Maintain version control for changes to reports.

Another important part of the penetration test that can aid you during reporting (and after) is note taking. For example, note taking can help you keep track of additional details that occurred during the activities that you do not want to miss mentioning in the report.

Alternatively, if after some time and other activities you are asked about this engagement in particular, you can refer back to your notes for any additional information that you may need.

It will be important to tailor your note taking depending on your needs and the client’s.

As this section is usually for internal use, it tends to be more flexible in regards to the needs of each penetration testing team, unlike the next section which is commonly tailored to a particular industry.

### Ongoing Documentation During Tests
---
Similar to note taking, documenting during the tests will help you greatly when writing your penetration testing report, but due to its importance it is commonly regarded as a mandatory process. It is of great value to give cohesion and consistency across the different results in the report.

Ongoing documentation of the activities allows for streamlined and uniform writing of important sections such as attack narrative and findings, which is of particular importance when your report is also being read by a regulator from your client’s industry.

Documenting your findings can be invaluable as proof to show the client and to prove your findings. Alternately, and notably, not being able to provide evidence for the claims in the report will greatly reduce its credibility. This could translate, in worst cases, to your client failing a cybersecurity recertification process.

To help in both the consistency and also simplicity of the procedure of ongoing documentation, screenshots can be employed and are highly recommended as an accompanying element.

### Grabbing Screenshots
---
Screenshots are a key component of ongoing documentation during tests. From these you can provide both evidence that an attack path was successful as well as provide a different insight on the attack rather than just text.

You should aim to grab only the relevant sections to minimize capturing information that is not needed for the report. In other cases, sensitive information is exactly what you need. For example, a screenshot of Mimikatz will clearly display a user password in cleartext or the hash of an important administrative account.

In some cases, teams prefer to store screenshots with a section of the password or hash censored or otherwise remove part of the sensitive information while leaving a section that proves the attack was successful.

You can work with the client to determine how to properly handle those events.

### Recognizing Common Themes/Root Causes
---
As you analyze vulnerability scan results and observe the target environment, you will encounter recurring conditions and/or common themes.

These can include:

- Lax physical security
- Employees not following corporate policy or best practices
- Lack of adequate cybersecurity training
- Lack of software patching and updating
- Lack of operating system hardening
- Poor software development practices
- Use of outdated networking protocols
- Use of obsolete cryptographic protocols

By identifying common themes like these, you may stumble on a pattern of behavior. This pattern could extend to assets that you haven't yet tested or hadn't planned on testing.

If you plan on testing them in the future, you can make certain educated guesses and assumptions that can make your job easier or lead you down certain paths that you otherwise wouldn't have taken.

Ultimately, identifying common themes provides you with a more complete picture of your target environment and its weaknesses.

### Identifying Vulnerabilities
---
The full list of vulnerabilities that the penetration testing team identified during the activities can be useful not only to the client but also to the team itself.

Even if the prioritized higher-rated vulnerabilities are the ones highlighted in the report, the client might still want to know their full exposure and what other remedies and solutions they should consider.

For the team, this information can provide insight on which high-rated vulnerabilities were not successfully exploited by the team and do further research on those. It can also provide useful information to the team regarding which are the most commonly exploited vulnerabilities as discussed in Common Themes/Root Causes.

Remember that you can always provide the full vulnerability details in the appendix of the report or as a separate file to keep the report concise.

### Outlining Best Practices
---
From the previous two report sections, Vulnerabilities and Common Themes/Root Causes, the penetration testing team can derive a consistent list of best practices and show where clients usually lack these controls.

It is also common to find industry-related best practices for the client and keep track of these during the activities as it will help not only in efficiently writing certain sections of the report, but it will also add value to it.

### Providing Observations
---
Observations are closely related to the concepts we just covered. These are the conclusions made out of the material we previously gathered, important highlights of issues found, and actions taken to resolve them, or simply notes to keep in mind for the next retest.

It can include more statements such as deviations from scope, changes in priority, and other important elements that should be considered for the report, future retest, and other client-related information.

### Summarizing Writing and Handling Reports
---
When writing and handling reports:

- Write your report with the target audience in mind.
- Consider including the following sections in your report:
- Executive summary
- Scope details
- Methodology
- Attack narrative
- Findings
- Risk rating
- Risk prioritization
- Metrics and measures
- Remediation
- Conclusion
- Appendix or supporting evidence
- Work with the client to determine their risk appetite.
- Write your report to speak to the client's risk appetite.
- Determine the file format for the report, such as Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, or HTML documents.
- Determine where the report will be securely stored.
- Follow best practices for securely handling the report.
- Determine how the formal hand-off of the report will happen between your PenTesting team and the client.

When developing recommendations for mitigation strategies:

- Consider people, processes, and technology when recommending mitigation strategies.
- Recommend strategies for common findings, such as:
- Shared local administrator credentials: Randomize credentials or use LAPS.
- Weak password complexity: Configure minimum password requirements and use password filters.
- Plaintext passwords: Use protocols that hash or encrypt passwords.
- No multi-factor authentication: Implement or require multi-factor authentication for access to critical systems.
- XSS attacks: Sanitize user input by encoding/escaping special HTML characters.
- SQL injection: Sanitize user input by parameterizing queries.
- Unnecessary open services: Perform system hardening.
- Physical intrusion: Incorporate guards, security cameras, motion alarms, and other physical security defenses.
- Recommend end-user training to mitigate social engineering attacks on end users.
- Recommend system hardening techniques like patch management and firewall configuration to secure hosts.
- Recommend MDM solutions for mobile infrastructure security.
- Recommend SDLC and best coding practices for secure software development.
