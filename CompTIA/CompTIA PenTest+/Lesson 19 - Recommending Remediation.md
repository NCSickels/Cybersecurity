## Lesson Introduction
---
In addition to conducting the PenTest exercise, part of the team’s duties is to recommend any remediation controls. Controls include technical controls, such as patch and configuration management, cryptographic key rotation, and network segmentation. Administrative controls are also essential and include guidelines on password management and organizational policies and procedures. In addition, the team should outline any operational and physical controls as well.

## Lesson Objectives
---
In this lesson, you will:

- Paraphrase essential technical controls that prevent a malicious actor from gaining control of a logical asset.
- Describe administrative and operational controls that include best practice business processes and user guidelines
- List physical security controls that are used to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive material.

## Topic 19A - Employ Technical Controls
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *3.5 Explain common attacks and vulnerabilities against specialized systems.*
> *4.2 Given a scenario, analyze the findings and recommend the appropriate remediation within a report.*

You have completed your PenTest, you have evaluated the company’s security, and now you need to remediate any issues you have found.

There are technical controls and best practices that should be employed to make a system more secure. If these are not employed, they should be recommended to the customer.

### Hardening the System
---
System hardening is the process of securing a device or application, usually to match the standards of the current system or network where it is being introduced. Hardware and software should be hardened as much as possible before they are added to a network.

Organizations should work on the assumption that the device or application is not safe when they receive it. The client should research and identify any issues that the manufacturer or publisher are already aware of. All known vulnerabilities should be addressed. Additional testing should be performed to attempt to uncover any additional vulnerabilities that are not already known.

Also the manufacturer of the hardware or software should be made aware of any vulnerabilities that you find as part of your testing.

Hardening techniques can include:

- Checking with any industry standards organizations that the client needs to comply with to see what guidelines they have for system hardening
- General standards for hardening are offered by ISO, SANS, NIST, CIS (Center for Internet Security), and more.
- Installing any patches and updates that hardware manufacturers and software publishers have made available
- Incorporating a patch management/change management process to optimize the patching process
- Ensuring systems are incorporating firewall and anti-malware solutions
- Ensuring firewalls are configured to uphold the principle of least privilege
- Disabling specific ports or services that are not needed
- Uninstalling any software that isn't needed
- Ensuring hosts are properly segmented from other hosts on the network


### Sanitizing User Input/Parametrized Queries
---
Input sanitization is the process of stripping user-supplied input of unwanted or untrusted data so that the application can safely process that input. It is the most common approach to mitigating the effects of code injection, particularly XSS and SQL injection.

Any online form that echoes input from the user back to the user on the web page or which stores input data within the web app database must be sanitized before the data is output or processed.

There are several tactics that are considered types of input sanitization, and each one has a different purpose and mitigates different types of attacks:

- Escaping
- Sanitization
- Allow list

Escaping**,** also referred to as encoding, substitutes special characters in HTML markup with representations that are called entities.

For XSS, the most prominent type of sanitization is escaping HTML special characters such as angle brackets (< and >) and the ampersand (&) to prevent them from being processed by the browser with the user input. For example, the entity for less than `(<) is &lt;` when encoded.

Entities ensure that the browser does not interpret malicious code as something that it should run. Depending on the language the page is written in, you will need to use the encoding command appropriate for that language.

In PHP, you can use the `htmlspecialchars()` function to escape major HTML characters:
```php
<?php function my_func($input) { echo htmlspecialchars($input, ENT_QUOTES, 
'UTF-8'); } ?> <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <?php my_func('<script>alert("XSS attack successful!");</script>'; ?> </body> </html>
```

The `htmlspecialchars()` function encodes the accepted `$input` input parameter, so that any instances of ampersands `(&`), double quotes (`"),` single quotes (`'),` less than symbols (`<),` or greater than symbols `(>`) in the input are turned into entities.

In the HTML below that, when the custom `my_func()` function is called with the malicious alert string, it gets encoded into:

```php
&lt;script&gt;alert(&quot;XSS attack successful!&quot;);&lt;/script&gt;
```

and, therefore, the browser will not run the script. This is known as sanitizing.

This type of encoding is sufficient for preventing XSS in many cases but not all. For example, encoding will not work in apps that need to accept HTML input. In those cases, you should use a sanitization library that is written to the relevant language. These libraries automatically parse and strip the user-supplied HTML input of untrusted data. Some example libraries include HtmlSanitizer (.NET), PHP HTML Purifier (PHP), SanitizeHelper (Ruby on Rails), and OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer Project (Java).

#### Additional XSS Mitigation Techniques
In addition to using sanitization libraries, you can also list the type of rich-text inputs that you have deemed safe for the web app to accept. Any inputs not matching the whitelist will be rejected. You can also replace raw HTML markup for rich text components with another markup language, such as Markdown. Attempts to inject malicious HTML code will prove ineffective.

#### Null Byte Sanitization
The most effective way of preventing the poison null byte is to remove it from the input entirely. Modern web app languages tend to handle this automatically, but you can also perform the sanitization manually if you are using an older version. For example, in PHP you can strip the null byte as follows:

```php
$file = str_replace(chr(0), '', $input);
```

Parameterized query, also called prepared statement, processes SQL input by incorporating placeholders for some of a query's parameters. When the query is executed, the web app binds the actual values to these parameters in a different statement.

So a quotation mark in a parameterized query would be interpreted literally, rather than be interpreted as if it were a part of the query structure. The input `x' OR 'x'='x` in the username field of a login form would force the database to look for a username that literally matched `x' OR 'x'='x` in its records.

Parameterized queries are the most effective means of preventing SQL injection attacks. Like other forms of input sanitization, how you implement parameterized queries will differ based on language.

For example, PHP uses an abstraction layer called PHP Data Objects (PDO) for processing database content:

```php
<?php
$prod_name = ""
$prod_desc = ""
// Code to connect to database
...
// Prepare statement
$stmt = $db_conn->prepare("INSERT INTO products (prod_name, prod_desc) VALUES (:prod_name, :prod_desc)");
$stmt->bindParam(':prod_name', $prod_name);
$stmt->bindParam(':prod_desc', $prod_desc);
?>
```

The `INSERT INTO` query is prepared, essentially creating a template for the database to parse. This parsed template is stored without being executed.

The input values for `$prod_name` and `$prod_desc` are then bound to each parameter and transmitted after the query itself. When plugged into the template, the input values are executed literally, preventing the web app from succumbing to any injected code.

### Implementing Multifactor Authentication
---
Just a few years ago, the cost of implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) could be quite high. More recently, it has become very affordable, costing as little as several dollars per person. MFA is therefore a more feasible strategy for even smaller businesses to adopt. It is especially useful in circumstances where users must authenticate to a system that gives them critical access to company resources or to their own PII and personal activities, such as online banking.

Even if the organization has systems that enforce password strength and complexity requirements, users will still tend to choose easily guessable and/or word-based passwords that a dictionary attack will make short work of. MFA can compensate for this weakness by requiring the user to also provide some other authentication or else they will be unable to log in.

Generally, authentication is classified as one of three types:

- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are

There are many authentication methods that supplement the "something you know" of password-based authentication. Generally, MFA requires, at a minimum, a second method of authentication outside of “something you know.” This could be a time-based one-time password (TOTP) provided by various authenticator apps installed on a smartphone.

This fulfills a "something you have" factor and can be combined with a username and password to sign in. Since many people have smartphones, this is not an overly strict requirement and, in some cases, the organization will issue smartphones to employees for them to use on the job.

Other examples of authentication factors used in MFA include smart cards or hardware tokens/key fobs (these are "something you have") and biometric fingerprint or retina scanners (which are "something you are").

### Encrypting Passwords
---
Storing passwords in cleartext should be avoided whenever possible. Ideally, passwords should always be stored in a secure format that prevents an attacker from easily reusing them, so even unsalted hashes might not be enough.

As mentioned before, implementing multi-factor authentication can help with keeping passwords from being reused, but some solutions do not readily support MFA.

For these reasons, it is always recommended to store passwords in an encrypted format. In cases where credentials are being stored for a particular service, a password manager or similar solution can be used as they commonly implement encrypted databases to store passwords.

### Remediating at the Process-Level
---
***Process-Level remediation*** is the concept of resolving a finding through changing how it is used or implemented. There might be technical challenges to simply patching or modifying the underlying systems of a process, so the remediation is done at the process-level itself.

Following the example of passwords and security, if a process is done through a non-secure channel, it can be migrated to use an encrypted channel of similar functionality. A simple example is using SSH whenever Telnet is being implemented but, as previously seen in [Lesson 14](https://learn.comptia.org/app/bank-for-certmaster-learn-for-pentest-exam-pt0-002#read/section/lesson-14-introduction-amp-objectives-1), Telnet is sometimes used when SSH is not supported, so an alternative solution will be required.

An example was discussed in [Lesson 18](https://learn.comptia.org/app/bank-for-certmaster-learn-for-pentest-exam-pt0-002#read/section/lesson-18-introduction-amp-objectives-1) for remediation, where randomized password rotation can be implemented.

### Managing and Applying Patches
---
***Patch management*** is the process of keeping track of managing and applying patches in a controlled manner. Referring back to our process-level remediation example, patch management would allow the organization to keep track of services needing patches, testing the updates, noting which ones have already been applied, and noting for which ones the technology did not allow patching but a mitigation strategy was implemented instead.

The testing of new patches and keeping track of mitigation strategies are considered to be the key portions of the patch management process, as they allow for business continuity while remaining secure from potential malicious actors.

### Rotating Keys
---
***Key rotation*** is the process of periodically generating and implementing new access keys to a server/service. Similar to password rotation, certain services use key files or strings to grant access, such as a server accessing a repository, and should be scheduled for periodic updates.

Many of the recommendations for passwords apply here, such as using a minimum length and setting up expiry periods for keys.

### Controlling the Certificate Process
---
#### Certificate Management
***Certificate management*** is the process of properly administering digital security certificates. This process includes managing proper storage and transmission of the certificate as well as the suspension and revocation done in response to certain cases.

When certificates are generated, for example to access a website securely through HTTPS, the private component of the certificate should be kept in secure storage and transmitted only over secure methods.

If it was stolen or otherwise negatively affected, a new certificate should be generated and implemented, and the old one should be removed and revoked.

#### Certificate Pinning
***Certificate pinning*** is the process of assigning a specific certificate to a particular element to avoid man-in-the-middle-attacks. It usually refers to, for example, assigning a particular certificate public key in order to connect to a website securely and if a different one is provided, it will get rejected without any further checks.

This will affect certain situations, such as when the private key of the website gets compromised and a new one is generated, the client that has the old certificate pinned will reject the new one without the usual steps of confirming with a Certificate Authority for old rejected certificates and new valid ones. Refer to [[Lesson 3 - Footprinting and Gathering Intelligence]] for more information on certificate pinning.

However, this may still be a valid approach in situations where we physically manage both server and client devices directly, such as in an internal network.

### Providing Secret Solutions
---
A ***secret management solution*** is a platform that controls passwords, key pairs, and other sensitive information that should be stored securely.

These solutions are usually paid software or services that include the security measures to keep secrets securely stored and commonly have support for different types of dynamic and static credentials.

### Segmenting Network
---
***Network Segmentation*** is the process of dividing the system infrastructure into different physical or virtual subdivisions. For the purposes of security, this will provide a separation between different levels of access requirements and security measures needed for different levels of services and users and allows for better security monitoring.

There are different examples of this, but a common one is to determine which services need to be internet-facing, which ones need to be both internet-facing and internally accessible, and which should be kept internal only. Network segmentation would separate these into different locations and only certain users and services would be allowed to communicate between the different segments.

This process is ideally done at a physical level to reduce the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited on the virtual solution. Alternatively, some virtual sub-nets are created specifically for the purpose of monitoring and alerting of suspicious activity.

## Topic 19B - Administrative and Operational Controls
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *4.2 Given a scenario, analyze the findings and recommend the appropriate remediation within a report.*

There are administrative and operational controls that should be implemented for best practice to make a system more secure.

If you do not see these implemented, they should be recommended to the customer.
<font style="color: red">VIDEO NEEDED</font>

### Implementing Policies and Procedures
---
Policies and procedures are what enable an organization to operate normally while minimizing cybersecurity incidents.

There are several important concepts to have in mind regarding secure policies and procedures, such as role-based access controls, password policies, mobile device management, and others.

For penetration testing, this would translate to analyzing the risk of the identified issues and implementing mitigating strategies on those policies and procedures, usually referred to as technical controls.

The following table shows an example of recommendations for the client on how to implement new security policies and modify procedures through technical controls:

|               **Step for Policy Implementation**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Employing Role-Based Access Control
---
***Role-Based Access Control*** is the security approach to restricting availability of a resource to authorized users only. For example, regular users do not have access to servers where developers test new applications, and developers don’t have access to human resources’ payroll database.

This can be done at different levels such as on the server as a whole, on a particular service, on a database, on a file, and so on. It is also done at a physical level by restricting, for example, which key card opens which door.

You need to balance technology with processes and people. For example, putting up a cement wall will help prevent access through the door that used to be where you put up the wall, but employees will no longer be able to access the area behind the wall without a door.

This may sound like an extreme example but be sure to consider ease of use against the need for security; if the security procedure is too complicated or odious, users will attempt to bypass it, resulting in a less secure environment.

### Enforcing Minimum Password Requirements
---
Often when a password is easily cracked it is due to people, process, and technology problems in concert. The organization might have a password policy in writing, but if it isn't being ensured through technological measures, this can leave the password vulnerable to attack.

If users create too simple of a password that is easily cracked, that is one end of the spectrum; if they make it so complicated that they need to write it down somewhere, they are meeting complexity requirements but are still leaving themselves open to social engineering where someone could just come into their space and find where the password was written down.

The following list includes mitigation strategies that you may want to present to your clients concerning secure password storage and transmission:

- Don't allow developers to hard-code credentials into apps.
- Hash stored passwords rather than storing them in plaintext.
- Use cryptographically strong hash functions, like SHA-256 and bcrypt.
- Avoid cryptographically weak hash functions, like MD5 and SHA-1.
- Use network access protocols that encrypt passwords in transit.
- For example, use SSH instead of Telnet, HTTPS instead of HTTP, FTPS instead of FTP, etc.
- Ensure network access protocols are using strong ciphers, like AES-256 and RC6.
- Avoid using network access protocols that incorporate weak cryptographic ciphers, like DES and 3DES.
- Disallow or reconfigure services that allow themselves to be negotiated down to a weaker cryptographic or protocol version.
- Ensure security solutions like IDS and data loss prevention (DLP) can monitor and manage unencrypted traffic in the network.

### Securing the Development Cycle
---
Whether the client organization develops its own software or leverages software provided by a third-party vendor, it should ensure that the security of this software is not an afterthought. Security should be an active component in the development process, not something that the organization applies reactively whenever an issue crops up. Secure software development should follow a ***software development life cycle (SDLC)*** .

An SDLC focuses primarily on the design, development, and maintenance of applications and other software. Development passes through several phases and, ideally, security is incorporated at each of those phases. For example, the testing phase should include techniques like ***fuzzing*** and input validation to identify whether the app is vulnerable to certain attacks, _before_ it is put into operation.

Adhering to an SDLC is crucial because it helps ensure that there are no gaps in the software's security at any point—from beginning to end.
![[Pasted image 20240702102751.png | 650]]
*The phases of a typical software development life cycle (SDLC).*

Adhering to best coding practices is also an important component of secure software development. Some examples of best practices include writing code that:

- Is clear and easy for other developers to grasp
- Has useful and informative documentation
- Is easy to incorporate in the build process
- Is highly extensible
- Has as few external dependencies as possible
- Is concise
- Relies on well-established techniques
- Integrates well with test harnesses
- Closely aligns with design requirements

#### Insecure Coding Practices
Related to this, the organization should also actively avoid insecure coding practices. The following are examples of insecure coding practices. Note that these apply to most types of software, including web apps:

- **Lack of input validation**. This negligent practice alone is responsible for most of the injection and scripting attacks mentioned in this topic.
- **Hard-coded credentials**. There are many ways these passwords could be exposed, including through SQL injection and XSS.
- **Storage and/or transmission of sensitive data in cleartext**. You can sniff cleartext data transmitted over a network or read exfiltrated cleartext data with minimal effort.
- **Unauthorized and/or insecure functions and unprotected APIs**. Sometimes these functions and APIs are kept around for compatibility purposes, despite the security risk. You may be able to leverage the weaknesses in these functions/APIs.
- **Overly verbose errors**. Whether intentional or not, some apps reveal a great deal about a code's structure and execution through error messages returned to the user. A simple form injection might return a SQL error revealing a table's column names, for example.
- **Lack of error handling**. Although revealing too much in an error can be a problem, not handling errors at all is an even bigger problem. For example, an app may not respond gracefully to unexpected input, crashing the app or corrupting data.
- **Hidden elements**. Just because an element is not immediately visible on the page doesn't mean you can't find it by exploring the page's code. In particular, you may be able to find sensitive data that is exposed in the page's DOM (i.e., the hierarchical tree-like structure of the HTML) but not displayed on the screen.
- **Verbose comments in source code**. Comments are not meant to be truly hidden from the client, just suppressed in the marked-up page. Some developers forget this and include sensitive information in comments, such as server-side functionality, snippets of old code, and other information that can help you identify weak points or attack vectors.
- **Lack of code signing**. Code that lacks a digital signature cannot be validated for its authenticity and integrity. It may be easier to inject malicious code into a running process when no mechanisms exist to compare that code against the authorized code.
- **Race conditions**. These occur when the resulting outcome from execution processes is directly dependent on the order and timing of certain events. Issues arise if these events fail to execute in the order and timing intended by the developer. For example, an app can check that a file exists and then use it later. You may be able to replace the file after it is checked by the app but not yet used; this can trigger app instability or privilege escalation.

### Managing Organizational Mobile Devices
---
***Mobile device management (MDM)*** is the process of tracking, controlling, and securing the organization's mobile infrastructure. MDM solutions are usually web-based platforms that enable administrators to work from a centralized console.

Using MDM, the organization can enforce its security policies, as well as manage applications, data, and other content, all at once on every mobile device that connects to the private network, rather than applying security controls to each device individually.

Ultimately, MDM might be a worthwhile investment for organizations whose mobile infrastructure is at risk of compromise.

Common features of MDM solutions include:

- Pushing out OS, app, and firmware updates to devices
- Enrolling and authenticating devices
- Enforcing a security policy layer on applications
- Locating devices through GPS and other technologies
- Configuring devices with specific profiles according to access control policies
- Sending out push notifications to groups of devices
- Enabling devices to use remote access technologies
- Enabling remote lock and wipe capabilities
- Constructing an encrypted container on devices in which to keep sensitive organization data

From a broader perspective, additional policies and procedures that can be recommended for clients to implement include:

- Perform monthly vulnerability scans.
- Perform annual or biannual penetration tests.
- Have key performance indicators (KPIs) that management can use at-a-glance to see the security effectiveness of new technology. Examples include:
	- Overall security incident trends
	- Length of time between a discovered vulnerability and its remediation
	- Length of time between incident/problem and recovery/resolution
	- Rate of recurrence of the same security problem
- Follow the 80/20 rule in risk reduction.
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Implement multiple layers of security, each targeting at least 80% of coverage. Cumulatively, each layer will compensate for gaps in other layers and, together, they will narrow the attack surface.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">80% of vulnerabilities can be remediated with 20% of the cost and effort.</mark>

### Implementing People Security Controls
---
A PenTest team needs to recommend mitigation solutions for people, processes, and technology to deal with any discovered vulnerabilities. These all need to be considered together so that your recommendations do not result in gaps. All three of these factors often overlap, so hardening one without hardening the others will still result in vulnerabilities.

It is also important that the security strategies you recommend balance security and functionality, as sometimes these concepts clash.

When it comes to people, they always have been, and probably always will be, the weakest link in security. In addition to plain old human error, people are also vulnerable to the many social engineering attacks that are in use.

Some of the mitigation strategies and techniques that you should recommend clients implement include the following:

|                    **Mitigation Strategy**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Outlining Other Operational Considerations
---
#### Time of Day Restrictions
***Time of day restrictions*** are types of security controls that rely on normal operating hours for users and limits the access they have when it is usually not needed. This can reduce the impact of stolen credentials being used in certain times of the day.

#### Mandatory Vacations
Another operational control that should be considered is mandatory vacations. Users are more likely to make mistakes when they are tired, stressed, or more likely to leave the organization. In cases where more people are needed to fulfill a role or position, job rotation can also help train new users for a particular role.

#### Job Rotation
***Job rotation*** is the practice of cycling employees though different assigned roles. This technique can help with both improving the understanding that staff has in overall business as well as improving flexibility in the tasks performed.

It can also help reduce stress when done with consideration of skill set and areas that are rotated. In turn, employees are less likely to leave the organization, which could introduce additional challenges and even security issues.

#### User Training
Remediation should include requiring end-user cybersecurity training for all employees. The users should be able to identify why it is important that everyone does their part in keeping the organization and its assets secure. Training should include:

- How to spot threats they might encounter on the job
- The consequences of succumbing to threats
- Tools to mitigate threats

If users find a suspicious device, they should be aware that they need to let the IT department know about the device. This includes items such as USB drives, tablets, laptops, and routers that they haven't seen previously. The IT department should have resources and procedures in place for what actions to take if such a device is found. This might include testing the device in a sandbox environment or connecting it to an air-gapped computer.

## Topic 19C - Physical Controls

> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *4.2 Given a scenario, analyze the findings and recommend the appropriate remediation within a report.*

Physical controls can prevent many of the physical attack vectors that are usually very successful in providing the penetration testing team with notably better access, social engineering opportunities, and other advantages that are not present remotely.

To mitigate these attack paths from being leveraged by a threat actor, there are different solutions to employ.

### Controlling Access to Buildings
---
This is the area in which ingress of people is managed according to their permission to enter the building itself or different areas of it.

A common implementation in high-rise buildings, for example, is through the use of RFID access cards on elevators, where certain floor buttons can only be activated when the correct key card is first provided.

Certain access control methods like RFID cards may be vulnerable to cloning and replay attacks, but there are other physical access controls that can provide added layers of security.

### Employing Biometric Controls
---
Biometric controls are enhanced forms of access control that rely on particular body features, such as the fingerprint or iris. These biological characteristics are unique enough to rely on them as access control measures, and technology is precise enough to be implemented in a reliable manner.

Common everyday examples include fingerprint scanners in laptops and face recognition features in smartphones when used to unlock the device.

### Utilizing Video Surveillance
---
Video surveillance is very straightforward: it involves monitoring through the use of cameras. A particular consideration for security is the use of networked surveillance for remote feed access. When using technology such as Wi-Fi or internet-connected features, it is important to consider the potential problems and additional attack vectors that might be introduced.

Wi-Fi attacks can disconnect the cameras from the network and lose video feed or, worse, provide an attacker with the video feed and vital information of the inside operations. Similarly, they can be used as pivots to navigate the network or perform other attacks.

For this reason, some of the best practices for video surveillance involves using wired over Wi-Fi connections, network segregation, and frequent patching of the camera firmware.
