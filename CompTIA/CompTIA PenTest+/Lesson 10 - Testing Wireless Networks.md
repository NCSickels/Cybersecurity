## Lesson Introduction
---
In addition to examining traffic on the wired Local Area Network (LAN), the team will also need to assess the security posture of the wireless LAN (WLAN). Wireless networks can fall victim to several different attacks. Attacks include relay, spoofing, and deauthentication attacks. In order to achieve this goal, the team will need to conduct a variety of tests to see if an attack using a rogue access point and other methods will be successful. To aid in this process, the team can use tools specific to wireless attacks that include Kismet, EAPhammer, and Spooftooph.

Today nearly 100% of businesses use Wi-Fi. Wireless technology has advanced over time and is an optimal option as it provides mobility and convenience. As a result, in most cases the team will need to evaluate the target organization's wireless networking infrastructure as part of the PenTest. In this section, we’ll review some of the Wi-Fi attacks that are possible such as eavesdropping, jamming, spoofing, and using an evil twin to deceive a client.

Let’s start with a review of the basics of securing a Wi-Fi connection.

### Securing Wireless Transmissions
---
Wireless transmissions are sent through the air using a radio wave and are not protected by a bounded media, such as a cable. Any human or device within range and direction of the signal will be able to intercept that signal, without needing to access or disrupt a physical networking infrastructure. Some wireless technology, like Wi-Fi, is omni-directional and doesn't even require that the intercepting entity be facing a specific direction, it only has to be within range. Because of this, wireless networking technology is at a greater risk of compromise from several types of attacks.

Wireless communication is pervasive in today’s society. A wireless access point (WAP) enables devices to connect to a local network, typically using the 802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard. A WAP is an entry point into a network and transmits data over the air to other devices and can be easily attacked. As a result, it is a worthwhile target to assess during the PenTest. Some best practice suggestions to protect Wi-Fi traffic include:

- Restrict access by securing your router
- Use anti-malware protection
- Change the default password on your device
- Use encryption to protect the data.

A WAP's susceptibility to compromise usually depends on the strength of its encryption scheme.

When sending and receiving wireless transactions on a LAN, there may be sensitive information transmitted. For example, if you are in a coffee shop that offers free internet, the connection might not be encrypted, which will leave your data exposed. A malicious actor might be able to obtain your information, such as credit card numbers or login credentials, by using traffic sniffing. Because of this threat, it’s best to encrypt data with the strongest protocol available.

Several encryption protocols have been developed to protect our wireless communications. The Wi-Fi alliance is influential in providing guidance on wireless standards and have worked to improve each iteration in the evolution of security protocols.

> [!warning] The IEEE working group for wireless local area networks (WLAN) is identified as 802.11. After each new wireless protocol is ratified, you’ll see it indicated by 802.11x, where x is the version. Periodically, IEEE will combine and rename a standard. For example, in 2007, the group combined multiple 802.11 standards that included a, b, d, e, g, h, i, and j to become IEEE 802.11-2007.

Over the years, the predominant encryption standard, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), has evolved to ensure improved protocols to secure wireless communication.

- **WPA** features the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP). TKIP dynamically generates a new 128-bit key for each packet. In addition, WPA includes a Message Integrity Check (MIC), which provides a stronger method (than a CRC) to ensure data integrity.
- **WPA2** is an improvement of WPA and replaced RC4 and TKIP with Counter Mode CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) using AES.
- **WPA3** <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">includes advanced features to secure wireless transmissions such as 192-bit encryption when using WPA3-Enterprise mode (used in business LANs). It also features improved authentication, employs a 48-bit initialization vector, and uses Protected Management Frames (PMFs) to prevent exposure of management traffic.</mark>

> [!warning] Of all the standards, WPA3 provides the most robust security and should be used if available.

A Wi-Fi signal is transmitted via a radio wave that can be sniffed, intercepted, and or jammed. Let’s explore this concept next.

### Gathering the Signals
---
One of the vulnerabilities of wireless transmission is that a malicious actor can use network sniffers like Wireshark to obtain WLAN transmissions.

#### Eavesdropping Communications
A wireless network interface will receive transmissions when activated, and by default will pick up on any transmissions that are bound for the interface's MAC address. When sniffing wireless transmissions, the interface should be placed in promiscuous mode, so that the device captures every transmitted frame. Therefore, you'll be able to capture all wireless traffic within range.

By sniffing traffic, you may be able to eavesdrop on communications between a client and an AP. This is more likely possible in public, open Wi-Fi networks that don't incorporate encryption. A network that uses encryption will make your eavesdropping more difficult, as the traffic you'll receive on the interface will be indecipherable without the proper authentication and decryption key. Nevertheless, even in encrypted modes, certain information is transmitted in cleartext, such as a client's MAC address, which you can use if you are launching a spoofing attack.

Once you lock on to the wireless traffic, you can disrupt the signal by deauthenticating a client.

#### Deauthenticating Clients
A deauthentication (deauth) attack will boot the victim(s) from an AP and force them to reauthenticate. A deauth is used so the victim generates the required traffic needed for the malicious actor to capture the handshake. The attack is possible because the 802.11 Wi-Fi protocol includes a management frame that a client can use to announce that it wishes to terminate a connection with an access point. You can take advantage of this provision by spoofing a victim's MAC address and sending the deauthentication frame to the access point, which then prompts the access point to terminate the connection.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Even in environments that use WPA/WPA2, you can initiate a deauthentication (deauth) attack to capture the four-way TKIP handshake in a Wi-Fi connection.</mark> The disconnected client must initiate the four-way handshake again in order to reconnect to the AP. You can then capture the pre-shared key (PSK) that is exchanged in this handshake and then attempt to crack the key.

Other than creating a simple denial of service, deauthentication attacks are used during evil twin, replay, and cracking attacks. They are also used by businesses such as hotels to force customers to stop using personal hotspots and start using the hotel's fee-based Wi-Fi services. Ultimately, a deauthentication attack can be a powerful technique for accomplishing several different malicious objectives.

There are several tools that can perform deauthentication.

You can use ***airodump-ng*** to sniff for the handshake:

**`airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <MAC address> -w capture wlan0`**

You can either deauthenticate a single client or all clients on a WAP. The following is an example of using aireplay-ng to deauthenticate all clients on a WAP:

**`aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <MAC address> wlan0`***

The **`-0 1`** flag specifies that the tool will send one deauthentication message. Using the **`-a`** flag, you specify the MAC address of the targeted access point. You can also use the **`-c`** flag with the MAC address of a target client in case you only want to knock a single client off the WAP instead of every client.

In addition to software, a hardware tool like Wi-Fi Pineapple can launch a deauthentication attack.

In some cases, a malicious actor might choose to jam a Wi-Fi signal. Let’s see how this is possible.

#### Jamming a Signal
***Jamming*** is an attack that disrupts a Wi-Fi signal by broadcasting on the same frequency as the target WAP, and any signals that a wireless transceiver is attempting to send or receive will be blocked. Physical jamming devices can send disruptive signals to several wireless devices in a targeted area. By jamming a Wi-Fi signal, a malicious actor can trigger a denial of service (DoS) and disrupt the flow of communications.

> [!warning] Jamming devices are illegal in many jurisdictions, including anywhere in the United States. You should consider the legality of radio jamming in your area before performing it as part of a test.

To launch a jamming attack, a malicious actor can either use a physical device or software jammer. For example, ***wifi jammer*** is a Python script that can jam (or disrupt) the signals of all WAPs in an area. You can also use wifi jammer to perform more targeted attacks to disable only select Wi-Fi networks in an area, or even specific clients.

In order to gain access to the communication stream in an encrypted conversation, you will have to obtain the password. Next, let’s investigate ways to obtain a password or PIN.

### Cracking the Password or PIN
---
In order to gain access to a digital device, many times there is some form of password protection. When creating a password, the algorithm will, in most cases, assess the strength of the password and warn you if the password is weak. If warned, you should make changes to improve the strength of the password, as many times, a successful password attack is dependent on a weak and predictable password.

In this section, we’ll compare a couple of methods to attack a protected communication stream, by either attacking WPA, or using a WPS pin attack. Let’s start with an overview of attacking WPA.

#### Attacking WPA
Most Wi-Fi networks today use WPA/WPA2 to provide a more robust method of preventing an attack. As a result, cracking a WPA/WPA2 password can be challenging. If you have managed to grab the password hashes during the handshake, you can use dictionary-based and brute force methods to try to crack the password offline.

The strength of encryption used in WPA/WPA2 makes an attack difficult; however, it can be achieved in the following circumstances:

- When using WPA, the use of rotating keys and sequence numbers can make a cracking attempt more difficult. However, WPA is still susceptible to dictionary attacks if a weak passkey has been chosen.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">When using WPA2, an attack might be possible by launching a</mark> ***key reinstallation attack (KRACK)***<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">, which can intercept and manipulate the WPA2 4-way handshake.</mark>

Another attack takes advantage of weaknesses in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) process in the form of a WPS PIN attack.

#### Accessing the WPS PIN
The WPS process is designed to streamline setting up a secure Wi-Fi network and enroll devices. However, along with the convenience comes a security risk, as a malicious actor may be able to access a WPS device by using either a physical attack or brute force the PIN.

A physical attack takes advantage of the “push to connect” feature found on many routers. When launching this attack, the malicious actor will need to be physically close to the device. For example, there might be a router in a doctor’s office that is in plain sight. In that case, a malicious actor can get close to the device and connect to the network, by doing the following:

- Press the WPS button on the router
- Select and connect the appropriate network on the laptop or other mobile device.

> [!warning] It’s important to note that this method only works on Windows, Blackberry, and Android OS. Other systems, such as MacOS, iPhone, and some Linux distros, such as Ubuntu and Mint, don’t support this operation.

In addition to a physical attack, a malicious actor can gain access to the network by determining the PIN number of the WPS device, using an online or offline brute force attack.

Any device that supports WPS will have an automatically generated eight-digit code. A malicious actor can launch an online attack using a tool called ***Reaver***, which is included in Kali Linux. Reaver can brute force a PIN by doing the following:

- Search and identify access points that are using WPS
- Once identified, Reaver will begin sending numerous PINS to the device, which you will see in the terminal: `Trying pin 12345670, Trying pin 00056748 …`
- If the basic attack isn’t successful, Reaver has advanced options, such as "Don’t send NACK packets when detecting errors," or "Delay 15 seconds between PIN attempts".

Keep in mind when launching a WPS attack using Reaver, this can take quite a while. In addition, an online attack might also be challenging, as many WAPs have a lockout function that activates after a certain number of failures. However, with Reaver you can slow the probes or pause and resume the attack later.

Many manufacturers have built-in defense mechanisms to defend against this type of attack. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If that is the case, a malicious actor might choose to launch an offline attack called Pixie Dust, using a tool called ***Bully***. Bully takes advantage of the way some routers generate random numbers. If a router uses a NULL value (00000000) or a timestamp of the current time value, you will most likely be able to launch an offline attack.</mark>

Next, let’s investigate attacks that use a man in the middle approach to gain access to sensitive information.

### Launching an On-Path or Relay Attack
---
An on-path is a MiTM attack whereby a malicious actor sits in the middle of a communication stream. One way a malicious actor can launch an on-path attack is during the authentication process prior to joining a WLAN.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In a corporate WLAN, clients generally must authenticate prior to gaining access to the network using the 802.1X authentication protocol. Once authenticated, a virtual port is created on the access point and the client can then access network resources.</mark>

When using 802.1X authentication, there are three main entities. The entities include a **Supplicant** (or Wi-Fi client), the **Authenticator** (or WAP), and the **Authentication Server** (AS), which is generally a RADIUS server that provides the authentication, as shown in the graphic:
![[Pasted image 20240604142223.png | 600]]
*802.1X Authentication Diagram*

To protect a communication stream, there are many variations of Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) which creates an encrypted tunnel between the supplicant and authentication server. Choices include:

- Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)
- EAP with Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS)
- EAP with Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST)

The process requires the use of certificates to create a secure tunnel. However, provisioning certificates to each wireless device during the encryption process is a considerable management challenge. In order to streamline the process, protocols such as **Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)** are designed to provide secure tunneling using _server-side_ certificates only. The supplicant does not require a certificate.

When using PEAP, once the server has authenticated to the supplicant, user authentication can then take place through a secure tunnel to protect against sniffing, password-guessing/dictionary, and on-path attacks.

The user authentication method, also referred to as the "inner" method, can use either MS-CHAPv2 or EAP-GTC. The Generic Token Card (GTC) method transfers a token for authentication against a network directory or using a one-time password mechanism.

To provide a secure connection there are two requirements:

- The inner, protected authentication must be secure so a malicious actor cannot sniff the password.
- The client _must validate_ the server certificate.

If the client doesn’t validate the server’s certificate, a malicious actor can put up a rogue AP and pass a bogus certificate to the client. At that point, if the client approves _or overrides the invalid server certificate_, this will allow the malicious actor to steal the client's credentials and use them to successfully authenticate to the real server.

In an on-path attack, a malicious actor sits in the middle of the stream and intercepts the genuine certificate. The malicious actor then passes a bogus certificate to the client as shown:
![[Pasted image 20240604142257.png]]
*On path MITM attack*

Instead of receiving the expected certificate from the web server, the client will receive a bogus certificate. This is possible because an app on the client side won’t always check the certificate, especially on a mobile device.

In some cases, there might be a notification from the operating system that the certificate is not recognized. This can be followed by a prompt that asks if the client would like to accept the certificate. If the user accepts, the spoofed certificate will be placed in the certificate store and be accepted as valid, and the transaction will continue in a normal fashion. The malicious actor will then be able to see the details of the transaction.

Another Wi-Fi attack attempts to deceive clients into connecting a rogue access point. Let’s explore this attack method.

### Deceiving Clients with an Evil Twin
---
An evil twin is a rogue access point that attempts to trick users into believing that it is a legitimate AP, such as an organization's official Wi-Fi network.

Getting users to join an evil twin is often accomplished by using a deauthentication attack. Once the client is kicked off the network, they may be able to trick them into reconnecting to the rogue AP.

Evil twin attacks are effective because it's not always easy for a user to determine which is the correct Wi-Fi network and which is the fake. To create an effective evil twin, the malicious actor can do the following:

- Set the SSID to be the same as the legitimate network.
- Place the evil twin close to the victim so that its signal strength is high, and it is put at the top of the victim's list of APs.

To get the victim to join the evil twin, a malicious actor can set up a convincing captive portal with open authentication. Once the victim joins the evil twin, the malicious actor can take control of the communication stream as they are essentially acting as a man in the middle.

> [!important] Note
> *Evil Twin attacks can be used for downgrade attacks.*

## Topic 10B - Explore Wireless Tools
---
> [!note] Exam Objectives Covered
> *3.2 Given a scenario, research attack vectors and perform wireless attacks.*
> *5.3 Explain use cases of the following tools during the phases of a penetration test.*

While assessing the security posture of the WLAN, the team can use a variety of wireless assessment tools. The tools can be used to achieve the following:

- Detect the presence of wireless networks.
- Identify the security type and configuration.
- Attempt to exploit any weaknesses in the security to gain unauthorized access to the network.

In this section, we’ll evaluate the different tools available such as Spooftooph, Kismet, and EAPhammer. While many are similar in nature, some provide advanced features to launch a more targeted attack.

### Attacking the WLAN
---
Once the team has a basic plan of attack for the WLAN, the next step is to move forward and begin discovery. Most wireless tools are similar in their capabilities and will move through the following phases:

1. Begin the site survey by scanning across all channels looking for any network in range.
2. Once identified, grade and sort the networks by signal strength, from strongest to weakest.
3. Begin gathering information on the networks in range, and specifically assess any obvious vulnerabilities.

During this process, the team will need to select an antenna based on the specific needs. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In addition, the capture device will need a wireless card that is able to support monitor mode and packet injection.</mark> Prior to testing, the team will also need to make sure that the capture device is equipped with the required tools and any companion software is installed as well.

Most wireless assessment tools can crack Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WPA, and WPS. However, in most cases you won’t be able to see any traffic using WEP, as it has been deprecated, and only about 2% of the Wi-Fi networks worldwide are using the protocol.

In this section we’ll cover some of the tools and their capabilities used during the PenTest WLAN assessment. Let’s start with an overview of Aircrack-ng.

#### Monitoring with Aircrack-ng
The ***Aircrack-ng*** suite of utilities is one of the early tools designed for wireless network security testing. The suite is made up of several command-line tools used for wireless monitoring, attacking, testing, and password cracking.

The principal tools in the suite are as follows:

- **Airmon-ng**—will enable and disable monitor mode on a wireless interface. Airmon-ng can also switch an interface from managed mode to monitor mode.
- **Airodump-ng**—provides the ability to capture 802.11 frames and then use the output to identify the ***Basic Service Set ID (MAC address)*** of the access point along with the MAC address of a victim client device.
- **Aireplay-ng**—Inject frames to perform an attack to obtain the authentication credentials for an access point, which is usually performed using a deauthentication attack.

Along with the normal packet capture and injection capabilities built into most wireless security tools, the Aircrack-ng suite can be used in several other attacks. Attacks include an ARP request replay, interactive packet replay and fake authentication attack. In addition, it can be used to configure a fake access point and to crack a WPA pre-shared key (PSK).

One common attack is to attempt to capture the handshake and extract the authentication key. Once obtained, the next step is to try to retrieve the plaintext password, using either a dictionary or brute force attack. It’s important to note that WPA/WPA2 passphrases can be recovered using brute force password cracking; however, this may not be successful, especially if the victim has used a strong passphrase.

Another popular wireless testing tool is Kismet—a wireless sniffer, network detector, and intrusion detection system.

#### Discovering Kismet
***Kismet*** is included in Kali Linux and has many different functions. In addition to capturing packets, it can also act as a wireless intrusion detection system. Once up and running, Kismet will search for wireless networks and identify what device is transmitting the traffic. In addition, if Kismet captures any handshake packets, it will preserve them to attempt to crack the password later.

Kismet primarily works on Linux and OSX on most Wi-Fi and Bluetooth interfaces. In addition to specialized adapters, it can also capture traffic when using software defined radio (SDR) devices. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">While it’s possible to run Kismet on Windows, using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) framework, you will need to run it remotely on a Kismet capture source, such as a Wi-Fi pineapple.</mark>

Another tool used to test a wireless network is Wifite2. Let’s take a look.

#### Assessing the WLAN with Wifite2
***Wifite2*** is a wireless auditing tool you can use to assess the WLAN. Once you launch Wifite2, you can begin a site survey and identify any active targets. After gathering the information, it will display a list of known targets and hidden access points. In addition, Wifite2 will display whether the network advertises WPS along with the type of encryption in use.

Once the network information is presented, you can select a target and begin an attack. Wifite2 can launch a variety of attacks to retrieve the password of a WAP, including the following:

- WPS (online) brute force PIN attack
- WPS (offline) Pixie attack
- WPA (offline) crack attempt
- WPA Pairwise Master Key Identifier (PMKID) (offline) crack attempt

If you select a group of targets, Wifite2 will proceed to attempt to capture handshakes and then attack the easiest targets first, such as a WPS Pixie attack. Once done it will then move to more challenging targets. It’s important to note, Wifite2 will move to the next target if the attempt is not successful and will not spend an exaggerated time period on any one target.

In addition to traditional Wi-Fi, the team may also want to investigate any Bluetooth signals that may be in range. Next let’s see how Spooftooph can spoof or clone a Bluetooth enabled device.

#### Exploring Bluetooth Enabled Devices
Although Bluetooth is a wireless technology, it uses a different method to transmit a signal. As a result, the team will need to use different tools to crack a Bluetooth enabled device.

Bluetooth uses adaptive frequency hopping so attempting to lock onto a signal in a traditional manner isn’t possible. In addition, once a device pairs with another device, there is no need to transmit the password again, so you won’t be able to capture it in the same way you would a traditional Wi-Fi device. However, the team will still be able to track a Bluetooth connection in order to identify a vulnerability.

> [!warning] When configuring a Bluetooth device on a Linux machine, use the command **`hciconfig`** in a terminal window.

One tool that can either spoof or clone a Bluetooth device is ***Spooftooph***. Keep in mind, before making any changes to a Bluetooth adapter, you must run Spooftooph with root privileges. Once in root, you can do the following:

- Specify or randomly generate the name, class and address.
- Scan for in-range devices and choose which device to clone.
- Clone random in range devices at random time intervals.
- Output scan results to a log file for use at a later time.

By spoofing the device, name, class, and address, the device will blend into the background and hide in plain sight whenever someone scans for Bluetooth devices. This can be helpful as some Bluetooth devices are paired with interesting or essential hardware devices, and you can observe the interaction.

Another PenTest exercise the team might attempt is to recover keys. Let’s see what tools are available to achieve this goal.

### Recovering Keys
---
Wireless security auditing might involve recovering and attempting to crack the wireless access point key. To prepare for this test, you will complete a few preliminary steps, such as doing a site survey and putting the interface into monitor mode.

The one important element that is common when using most Wi-Fi cracking tools is that you will need an extensive word list to use while testing the strength of the Wi-Fi password. You can find a list of passwords by going to the Rockyou.txt GitHub repository. However, there are more available. In addition, many PenTest teams have created their own word lists to use during the assessment.

As we have seen, the PenTesting team has many tools at their disposal. In this section, we’ll take a look at Fern, EAPHammer and MDK4. First, let’s see what’s possible when using Fern.

#### Auditing with Fern
***Fern*** is a Python-based program used to test wireless networks. Fern runs on a Linux OS and is able to recover WEP/ WPS/WPA/ keys using a variety of methods. Methods include bruteforce, dictionary, session hijacking, replay, and man in the middle attacks.

Prior to using Fern, you’ll need to make sure you have all essential dependencies such as:

- Python
- Aircrack-NG
- Macchanger

Fern is a commercial product; however, there is a free version as well that offers limited functionality and is part of the Kali Linux suite of tools. Once you launch the program, you will see a screen of the Fern toolbox as shown below:
![[Pasted image 20240604142749.png | 500]]
*Fern Wi-Fi cracker*

Fern has a user-friendly interface. After putting your adapter into monitor mode, you can begin the scanning process to find and select a network to test.

Next, let’s take a look at another tool that the team can use to launch a number of Wi-Fi related attacks.

#### Unearthing the Power of EAPHammer
***EAPHammer*** is another Python-based toolkit with a wide range of features. Included in Kali Linux, it provides several options that the team can use to launch an attack on a WPA2-Enterprise 802.11a or 802.11n network in an easy-to-use platform.

Prior to using EAPHammer, you’ll need to make sure you have all essential dependencies such as apache2, dnsmasq, and libssl-dev, along with generating any necessary TLS certificates. Once you have checked your dependencies and performed any necessary updates, you can plan your attack.

For example, you can launch a karma attack using an evil twin and trick someone into joining the bogus network. In addition, EAPHammer can also steal RADIUS credentials such as WPA-EAP and WPA2-EAP authentication, conceal or cloak an SSID, and perform captive portal attacks to capture Active Directory credentials.

Another multifunctional tool used to test the strength of a wireless network is mdk4.

#### Testing the Wi-Fi with MDK4
***MDK4*** is a powerful Linux based tool that features a wide range of attacks. It supports 2.4 to 5GHz and has nine attack modules. Each attack module is denoted by a single letter. A few of the attack modes are as follows:

- **Mode b**: create the appearance of many wireless networks
- **Mode a**: authentication DoS will send multiple authentication frames to WAP in range with the intent of overwhelming the AP
- **Mode p**: probes AP for SSID and bruteforce any hidden SSIDs
- **Mode d**: will send a deauth to disconnect and disassociate all clients from an AP
- **Mode w**: will provoke an Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems confusion attack

As you can see, when using MDK4, the team can launch several attacks on the WLAN. However, when testing with this tool use caution, as some of the attack modules can have a serious negative effect on the network.
