* OSINT includes data from publicly available sources, such as DNS registrars, web searches, security-centric search engines like *Shodan* and *Censys*, and a myriad of other information sources. 
* Common Weakness Enumeration
* *Note: LinkedIn and job posting sites can be particularly valuable when attempting to identify an organization's technology stack. Pay attention to certifications, job responsibilities, and technologies mentioned in resumes, job postings, and profiles to improve your knowledge of what the company likely has in use.*
* Domain registrars provide the interface between customers and the domain registries and handle purchase, billing, and day-to-day domain maintenance, including renewals for domain registrations.
* The central authority for domain ownership and registration is the **==Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)==** - https://www.iana.org.
* *Note: many domain owners reduce the amount of visible data after their domains have been registered for sometime, meaning that historical domain registration information can be a treasure trove of useful details. Services like **domainhistory.net** and **whoismind.com** provide a historical view of the domain registration information provided by WHOIS, which means that you can still find that information.*
* *Note: remember that, even though you’re often see certificates referred to as SSL certificates, they’re actually using TLS.*
* A DNS zone transfer (AXFR) is a transaction that is intended to be used to replicate DNS databases between DNS servers. 
	* Host: `host -t axfr domain.name dns-server`
	* Dig: `dig axfr @target.nameserver.com domain.name`
	* Nmap (using Nmap Scripting Engine): `nmap -script dns-zone-transfer.nse -script-args dns-zone-transfer.domain<domain> -p53 <hosts>`
	* https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php
* A list of Public BGP route information servers (*BGP looking glasses*) can be found at http://www.bgp4.as/looking-glasses.
* Shodan - provides prebuilt searches, as well as categories of search for industrial control systems, databases, and other common search queries.
* Censys- similar to Shodan; will provide Geo IP information. If it is available, a comprehensive summary of services, the host, exposes, and drill down, links for highly detailed information.

- *Note: Packet capture has another major use during penetration tests: documentation. Many penetration testers will most if not all of the traffic that they generate during their penetration testing efforts. If something goes wrong, the logged traffic can be used to document what occurred and when. Packet captures can also be useful if you think you missed something or cannot get a response to reoccur.*

- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
-----
- Describes specific security controls for merchants who handle credit card transactions and service providers who assist merchants with these transactions. This standard includes what are arguably the most specific requirements for vulnerability scanning of any standard.
- *Note:* Contrary to what some believe, PCI DSS is *not* a law. The standard is maintained by an industry group known as the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC), which is funded by the industry to maintain the requirements. Organizations are subject to PCI DSS because of contractual requirements rather than legal requirements.
- PCI DSS prescribes many of the details of vulnerability scanning: 
	- Organizations must run both internal and external vulnerability scans (PCI DSS requirement 11.2).
	- Organizations must run scans on at least a quarterly basis and "after any significant change in the network (such as new system component installations, changes in network topology, firewall rule modifications, product upgrades)" (PCI DSS requirement 11.2).
	- Internal scans must be conducted by qualified personnel (PCI DSS requirement 11.2.1).
	- Organizations must remediate any high-risk vulnerabilities and repeat scans to confirm that they are resolved until they receive a "clean" scan report (PCI DSS requirement 11.2.1).
	- External scans must be conducted by an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) authorized by PCI SSC (PCI DSS requirement 11.2.1).

### Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)
-----
- Requires that government agencies and other organizations operating systems on behalf of government agencies comply with a series of security standards. The specific controls required by these standards depend on whether the government designates the system as low impact, moderate impact, or high impact, according to a set of definitions. Further guidance on system classification is found in Federal Information Processing Stand (FIPS) 199: Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems. 

#### Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations
-----
**-->** [NIST 800-53, Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final)

- Each organization subject to FISMA must meet the following requirements, described in the section "Control Description":
	- Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/application are identified and reported;
	- Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:
		1.  Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;
		2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and
		3.  ﻿﻿﻿Measuring vulnerability impact;
	-  Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;
	- Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and
	- Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e. systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).

- These requirements establish a baseline for all federal information systems. NIST 800-53 then describes eight control enhancements that may be required depending on the circumstances:
	1. The organization employs vulnerability scanning tools that include the capability to readily update the information system vulnerabilities to be scanned.
	2. The organization updates the information system vulnerabilities scanned prior to a new scan (and/or) when new vulnerabilities are identified and reported.
	3. The organization employs vulnerability scanning procedures that can identify the breadth and depth of coverage (i.e., information system components scanned and vulnerabilities checked).
	4. ﻿﻿﻿The organization determines what information about the information
	5. System is discoverable by adversaries and subsequently takes organization. defined corrective actions.
	6. ﻿﻿﻿The information system implements privileged access authorization to information system components for selected vulnerability scanning activities.
	7. ﻿﻿﻿The organization employs automated mechanisms to compare the results of vulnerability scans over time to determine trends in information system vulnerabilities.
	8. ﻿﻿﻿(Withdrawn by NIST)
	9. ﻿﻿﻿The organization reviews historic audit logs to determine if a vulnerability identified in the information system has been previously exploited.
	10. ﻿﻿﻿(Withdrawn by NIST)
	11. ﻿﻿﻿﻿The organization correlates the output from vulnerability scanning tools to determine the presence of multi-vulnerability/multi-hop attack vectors.

Note that requirements 7 and 9 were control enhancements that were previously included in the standard but were later withdrawn.
In cases where a federal agency determines that an information system falls into the moderate impact category, it must implement control enhancements 1, 2, and S, at a minimum. If the agency determines a system has high impact, it must implement at least control enhancements 1, 2, 4, and 5.

### Active vs. Passive Scanning
-----
- Passive vulnerability scanning: Instead of probing systems for vulnerabilities, passive scanners monitor the network, similar to the technique used by intrusion detection systems. But instead of watching for intrusion attempts, they look for the telltale signatures of outdated systems and applications, reporting results to administrators. 
- ==Passive vulnerability scans are **ONLY** capable of detecting vulnerabilities that are reflected in network traffic.==

### Configuring and Executing Vulnerability Scans
-----
- The *scope* of a vulnerability scan describes the extent of the scan, including answers to the following questions:
	- What systems, networks, services, applications, and protocols will be included in the vulnerability scan?
	- What technical measures will be used to test whether systems are present on the network?
	- What tests will be performed against systems discovered by a vulnerability scan?
